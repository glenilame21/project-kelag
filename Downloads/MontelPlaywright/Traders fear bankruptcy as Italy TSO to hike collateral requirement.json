        "subtitle":"(Montel) Italian TSO Terna\u2019s proposed changes to dispatching guarantees could force energy traders to boost collateral deposits by up to 16-fold, threatening smaller renewable producers\u2019 viability and potentially driving up spot power prices by EUR 5-6\/MWh, traders told Montel.",
        "body":"All 12 trading companies contacted by Montel to discuss the measures\u00a0said the increased financial collateral\u00a0requirements in the plan\u00a0would particularly impact smaller traders who aggregate output from multiple small renewables installations. They said this could force some to exit the market or significantly reduce operations.\nTerna\u2019s consultation period on the proposals runs until\u00a0next Monday\u00a0and if confirmed will be introduced in the next six months.\nFor medium- and low-voltage connected installations, Terna proposes extending required financial collateral from five to 45 days of the value of a plant\u2019s nominal production capacity. Around 90% of Italy\u2019s solar installations are connected to these grids, traders said.\nFor a 5 MW hydropower plant, guarantees would surge\u00a0from EUR 50,000 at present\u00a0to EUR 625,000 under the new rules, industry group Assoidroelettrica said.\nThe total increase in guarantees held by Terna just for small non-dispatchable units could reach EUR 1-1.5bn, which the group warned could have \u201csystemic implications\u201d.\nSome\u00a0trading firms\u00a0calculated that their guarantee requirements could jump\u00a0by 16-fold\u00a0under the proposed changes, said Gabriele Franze, Italy country manager at\u00a0trading firm\u00a0Inxieme Energia.\n\u201cTwilight zone\u201d\u201cIf this goes through, smaller producers will be trapped in a twilight zone where no one\u00a0will buy their power as it will be too expensive, and over time many of these businesses will not be sustainable,\u201d said Michele Burbi, CEO of\u00a0trading firm\u00a0Eco Trade.\nMatteo Donati, managing partner of renewables developer ReFeel,\u00a0said that although\u00a0\u201cdispatching guarantees don\u2019t affect us directly because we don\u2019t dispatch, traders will likely pass these extra costs on to us\u201d.\nMarket participants said the changes could slow Italy\u2019s renewable energy expansion and lead to increased market concentration.\u00a0\n\u201cAbsurd situation\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an absurd situation,\u201d said Diego Pellegrino, head of energy trading association Arte.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re talking about requesting guarantees from plants that far exceed their annual turnover. This excessive collateral is not justified by any market parameters, correctness, security or guarantee.\u201d\nThe \u201cguarantees are being hiked at a time when the banking system is extremely rigid, so it\u2019s basically a gift to the banking system which, if it issues this type of guarantee, will profit again from something that is excessive collateral\u201d, he added.\u00a0\nThe changes would particularly impact solar installations below 10 MW \u2013 representing more than 70% of Italian solar generation \u2013 as major utilities like Enel typically only handle larger volumes.\u00a0\nOnly 4-5 companies in Italy, including Eni and Enel, with investment-grade ratings from top agencies would be exempt from the new requirements.",
