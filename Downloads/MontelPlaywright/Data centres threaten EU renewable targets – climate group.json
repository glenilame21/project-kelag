        "subtitle":"(Montel) European data centre power demand could surge as high as 287 TWh by 2030, potentially undermining the EU's green transition by diverting renewable power from other sectors, a climate advocacy group said on Monday.",
        "body":"The expected 160% gain in data centre power demand from 110 TWh in 2022 is equal to Spain\u2019s current annual consumption and without clear policies linking new demand to additional renewable capacity could potentially increase EU reliance on fossil gas, Beyond Fossil Fuels said in a study.\nThe study comes as world leaders and technology CEOs meet at an artificial intelligence summit in Paris.\nOf the anticipated 287 TWh power demand, half could come from new data centres, the study said. It pointed out that gas-fired power generation could rise to 84.3 TWh by the end of the decade from 10 TWh in 2025.\nUnder such a high-demand scenario with maximum renewable usage, data centres could require 138 TWh of renewable power by 2030, accounting for 21.2% of the EU\u2019s projected renewable energy additions, up from 18.1% in 2023.\n\u201cEven with a slower growth rate, under low demand, the industry\u2019s power demand could still be 218 TWh in the year 2030, which is enough to power Portugal and Poland combined,\u201d it said.\nRenewables squeezeThe data centre demand growth could compete directly with other sectors for renewable power supplies, potentially hindering electrification efforts in transport and industry, the report added.\n\u201cNew data centre demand alone could consume as much as the added power needed for the electrification of the entire transport sector in the EU by 2030,\u201d requiring about 130 TWh of additional demand, it added.\nThe report noted that wind and solar would likely be the main renewable power sources for new data centres, as other technologies faced significant limitations.\n\u201cTraditional nuclear energy will not be available at the scale, speed, and costs needed,\u201d it said, adding that small modular reactors would not be ready within the next five years.\nWhile some hydropower and biomass development was underway in Europe, these sources would \u201clikely remain marginal,\u201d it added.\nData centres currently consume around 104-110 TWh annually, representing 3.4% of Europe\u2019s total power generation of 3,099 TWh, according to the report.",
