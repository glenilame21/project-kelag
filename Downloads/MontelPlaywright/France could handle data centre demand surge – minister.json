        "body":"\u201cIf we consume more [power] in France, yes, exports are likely to fall, but the idea is to create value in France,\u201d Pannier-Runacher told journalists on the sidelines of the AI Action Summit in Paris.\nPresident Emmanuel Macron\u00a0has encouraged companies to set up data centres in the country to power AI usage.\nFrance could currently \u201ccomfortably accommodate\u201d strong data centre growth as the country had \u201creduced [its] electricity consumption to a historically low level\u201d, Pannier-Runacher said, responding to Montel questions.\n\u201cWe are back to 2005 [consumption] levels and we have increased our electricity production by around 30% compared to 2022. As a result, France exports around 25% of its power output,\u201d the minister said.\nFrance\u2019s net power exports hit a 22-year high\u00a0in 2024, amid buoyant nuclear and hydropower supply, TSO data showed.\nPannier-Runacher also expected data centres to increase flexibility in the French power system.\n\u201cWhen you have production capacities that produce continuously and abundantly, you can supply data centres 98% of the time, and make them lower consumption during demand spikes,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIn the near term, we do expect the energy consumed by AI applications to increase\u2026 but there is very rapid innovation happening that is driving efficiency and optimisation around AI,\u201d Joshua Parker, head of sustainability at AI chip company Nvidia told Montel.\nGrid concernsHowever, grid infrastructure was increasingly a concern, the IEA\u2019s chief energy economist Tim Gould told the conference.\n\u201cGrids are becoming a bottleneck\u2026 [some] renewable projects at advanced stages of development cannot access the grid,\u201d he said, adding that there were shortages of cables and transformers.\nA spokeswoman said that TSO RTE currently had grid connection requests totalling 4 GW, equivalent to around 3% of France\u2019s total generation capacity.\nState-owned utility EDF would offer four sites on its property for the construction of data centres, totalling 2 GW, it said late on Monday. It aims to provide two more sites by 2026.\nClimate advocacy group Beyond Fossil Fuels\u00a0has estimated that European data centre power demand could surge to as high as 287 TWh by 2030, while consultancy McKinsey sees demand rising to over 150 TWh by then, from around 62 TWh today.",
