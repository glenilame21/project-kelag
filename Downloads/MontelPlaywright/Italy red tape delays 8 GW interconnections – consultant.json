        "subtitle":"(Montel) Italian regulatory hurdles and TSO Terna\u2019s lack of support is delaying more than 8 GW of interconnections, an industry expert told Montel, while others agreed projects were being held up that could reduce power prices.",
        "body":"Key challenges included Italy\u2019s unsynchronised permitting process with neighbouring countries,\u00a0as well as engaging communities and managing costs, especially for underground cables in\u00a0the mountainous north, said Giuseppe Gatti of consultancy Energy Advisors.\u00a0\nThe most advanced\u00a0projects from private developers, known as merchant lines, are mainly on Italy\u2019s northern border, where up to 1 GW could be quickly developed, said Gatti, who is advising on a new 300 MW interconnection with Austria.\nDevelopers\u00a0of these interconnections\u00a0take on investments typically handled by TSOs, recovering costs over 8-12 years. However, after this period, Italian law requires the asset\u00a0to be sold\u00a0to the TSO, he said.\u00a0\nTSO hesitance\u201cAll TSOs, especially Terna, see these projects as intrusions and are very conservative in assigning net transfer capacity (NTC),\u201d he said.\nThe NTC is the maximum capacity an interconnector can import or export, determined by TSOs.\n\u201cTerna is reluctant to invest in these projects and often discourages them by assigning capacities that make them financially unviable,\u201d Gatti said,\u00a0pointing to an example of\u00a0a 200 MW project receiving an NTC up to 75% lower.\nNo appeal process existed, Gatti said, calling for an independent authority to define capacity allocations.\u00a0\nTerna declined to comment when contacted by Montel.\nLower power pricesHe agreed with Riccardo Siliprandi, senior principal at Afry in Italy,\u00a0that more interconnections would lower power prices and boost exports.\nStrengthening the interconnection with Austria could partially reduce Italy\u2019s\u00a0current spot power\u00a0price differential of EUR 9.53\/MWh, said Gatti,\u00a0to a\u00a0range of EUR 8-12\/MWh.\nIn 2024, more than 84% of\u00a0Italy\u2019s power\u00a0imports\u00a0came\u00a0from France and Switzerland. Austria accounted for 5%, Slovenia for just over 3%, while the rest was shared between Montenegro, Greece, and Malta.\nLast year, French power prices were lower than Italy\u2019s 97% of the time, according to GME\u00a0energy exchange\u00a0and LSEG Data & Analytics.\n\u201cInterconnections are key for renewables integration, given the complementarity between wind power in\u00a0northern Europe \u2013 stronger at night and in winter \u2013 and solar in the\u00a0south, which peaks in summer and during the day,\u201d said Siliprandi.\u00a0\nItaly\u2019s current\u00a0merchant line projects include\u00a0plans\u00a0for two cables of 2 GW each to\u00a0Tunisia and a 2 GW interconnector with Spain.",
