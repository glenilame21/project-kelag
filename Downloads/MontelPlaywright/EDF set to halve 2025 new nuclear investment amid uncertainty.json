        "subtitle":"(Montel) French utility EDF is almost halving next year\u2019s investments in preparation work to build six nuclear reactors to EUR 1.1bn amid uncertainty for the sector, a source close to the matter told Montel late on Wednesday.",
        "body":"The state-owned company is waiting for financial support from the government to raise the billions of euros needed to build a nuclear programme that includes six new generation\u00a0European pressurised reactors\u00a0(EPR2s)\u00a0in France.\nLast month, the official body responsible for a financing decision regarding the six reactors\u00a0postponed\u00a0approval from December until early next year amid political uncertainty and the collapse of the caretaker government earlier this month.\nHowever, the budget cut from the planned EUR 2bn for 2025 would not impact the programme schedule, the source added. \u201cIt just means investing less in 2025 and perhaps more afterwards.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s more a question of redefining the speed to enable us to make progress on both the basic design [of the\u00a0EPR2] and everything to do with compliance,\u201d the source said, adding that engineering teams could not keep up with the current pace.\nCostsEarlier this year, EDF CEO Luc Remont\u00a0said\u00a0EDF\u2019s expenditure on the\u00a0EPR2\u00a0programme would reach EUR 3bn by the end of this year, with EUR 2bn already spent on the programme.\nEDF is due to submit an updated estimate of the cost of the work to the government by February, the source said. The latest estimate, excluding financing costs, is EUR 67.4bn.\nThe utility aims to build six and possibly 14 new reactors by 2050, with construction due to start at the Penly nuclear power plant on the Channel coast by 2027.\u00a0\nHowever, its Flamanville EPR \u2013 due to\u00a0launch\u00a0on Friday, 12 years behind schedule \u2013 cost more than EUR 13bn.",
