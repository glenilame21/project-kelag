        "subtitle":"(Montel) Cyberattacks on Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure \u2013 which includes nuclear power \u2013 have escalated as Russia\u2019s invasion enters a third year, enabling European utilities to learn from Kyiv\u2019s front-line experience, the head of cybersecurity at Ukrainian tech firm Modus X told Montel.",
        "body":"\u201cThese attacks have become an integral part of the hybrid war against Ukraine,\u201d said Yurii Shatylo, whose Kyiv-based company is responsible for protecting Ukraine\u2019s largest private energy firm, Dtek, from cyberattacks.\n\u201cEach year, cyberattacks grow more sophisticated, frequent and destructive, posing serious challenges to the stability of the Ukrainian energy system,\u201d he added.\nAs an example, Russia had been carrying out attacks on critical infrastructure in both the physical \u2013 such as missile strikes \u2013 and cyber domains, simultaneously, to inflict maximum damage, he said.\n\u201cThe energy sector has become the primary target for our adversaries,\u201d he said, noting blackouts, or complete power outages, were part of Russia\u2019s strategy to undermine economic stability and morale.\nIn late December, Dtek said its thermal power plants had endured over 200 missiles, drone and artillery strikes since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in February 2022.\nSome of the main types of cyberattack in 2024-2025 have included ransomware attacks, denial of service (or Dos) attacks \u2013 which aim to overload systems to disrupt services \u2013 and data breaches, where sensitive information is stolen, Shatylo said.\nHe also cited incidences of phishing, where a scam email is sent containing links to malicious websites, and cyber espionage, which is state-sponsored hacking, targeting governments, armed forces and infrastructure.\nNot luck, but careful preparationWith energy firms across Europe experiencing increased occurrences of cyberattacks, and ramping up their own security and system resilience testing, Shatylo said they could learn from Ukraine\u2019s experiences.\nMontel reported earlier this month that up to 40 GW of Europe\u2019s wind and solar power sites were vulnerable to cyberattack, amid a security flaw, and UK TSO National Grid has started removing components from its grid supplied by a Chinese state-backed company, over cybersecurity fears.\n\u201cCyber resilience is not luck, but the result of careful preparation,\u201d Shatylo said.\nUkraine\u2019s energy infrastructure includes 15 operable Russian-made reactors at four plants that normally generate about half of its electricity. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, situated close to the front lines, was the first to come under armed attack in March 2022, and its six reactors are all in cold shutdown \u2013 where the fission reaction is slowed significantly or halted completely \u2013 for safety reasons.\n\u201cTrust no one\u201d\u201cThe lesson that other countries should learn from Ukraine\u2019s experience is that strengthening cybersecurity is an important foundation of resilience for businesses and the state,\u201d the cybersecurity expert said.\n\u201cFirstly, you need to build multi-layered security [and then] you need to provide regular updates to your system, applications, tools and technologies.\u201d\nAt the same time, companies need to implement a \u201czero-trust principle\u201d.\n\u201cTrust no one,\u201d Shatylo said, also citing the importance of \u201ccyber hygiene\u201d, or the raising of awareness among employees of the possible threats. \u201cMost attacks begin with the human factor.\u201d\nMontel reported in May last year that Modus X had foiled millions of cyberattacks\u00a0on Ukrainian energy infrastructure since the 2022 invasion.",
