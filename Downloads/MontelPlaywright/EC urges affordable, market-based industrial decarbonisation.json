        "body":"\u201cThe road for electrification goes through affordable energy,\u201d the EC\u2019s director for green transition, Lukasz Kolinski, told an event on future power demand hosted by think tank Bruegel in Brussels on Wednesday.\nLowering energy prices and improving industrial competitiveness are key policy priorities for the EC over the next five years. It intends to unveil an EU\u00a0affordable energy action plan on 26 February, along with a clean industrial deal strategy paper.\nKolinski would not reveal what would be in these but said that different elements of power prices influence how attractive it is for industrial sectors to switch from fossil fuels to\u00a0low-carbon and renewable\u00a0electricity.\nTaking the \u201cright action\u201d on taxes and grid charges in prices, for example, could\u00a0carry\u00a0the EU a \u201clong way\u201d towards market-based electrification, he said.\nThe EC saw electrification as the first option for decarbonising industry, and it was \u201cnot good\u201d that the share of electricity in the EU\u2019s final energy demand has been stagnant for years, said Kolinski.\nThis share has remained at 23% overall and around 33% in industry\u00a0for almost the past decade,\u00a0according to power lobby Eurelectric.\u00a0It cited\u00a0the reasons as including high upfront costs, long investment cycles, increased energy costs, unfair taxation and fossil fuel subsidies, in a paper\u00a0released yesterday calling for an EU electrification bank.\nNegative price hoursAnother key issue was how flexible existing and future demand will be to balance markets with increasing shares of renewables, said Kolinski.\nThe EU\u00a0saw\u00a0a record number of negative price hours last year, and\u00a0he said\u00a0he expected this year to be the same.\nFrench utility EDF\u00a0approved of new supply\u00a0being slightly ahead of demand, but it would be a problem if it was too far\u00a0ahead, its director of EU affairs, Marion Labatut, told the event.\n\u201cIf we keep adding generation that produces in the middle of the day, then we need to find demand or storage to take that, or next year we will get even more negative price hours,\u201d she said.\n\u201cPolitical consequences\u201dThe key challenge was synchronising new clean power generation with grid connections and upgrades,\u00a0as well as\u00a0new demand, said Kolinski.\nIf supply was too far behind new demand, it caused price spikes and they had \u201cimmediate political consequences\u201d,\u00a0he said.\nThe EU agreed\u00a0on\u00a0new electricity market design rules last year intended to make integrating large shares of renewables more efficient and to increase flexibility in demand. The focus now was on national governments implementing the rules, he said.",
