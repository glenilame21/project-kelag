        "subtitle":"(Montel) The prospect of EU sanctions this year on Russian LNG imports could prove risky for supply, given LNG project delays, high gas prices and uncertainty regarding US president Donald Trump\u2019s stance on Russia, analysts told Montel.",
        "body":"European gas supply remained\u00a0\u201ctight\u201d, warned Anne-Sophie Corbeau, global research scholar at the Columbia\u00a0University\u2019s Center on Global Energy Policy.\u00a0\n\u201cGas stocks are within the\u00a0five-year average, but we are not in the same situation as last year,\u201d she said, pointing to the loss of 15bcm of gas since the expiry of the transit deal through Ukraine\u00a0at the start of January.\nLast week,\u00a0a group of 10 EU nations said, as reported by Bloomberg, that they wanted a full ban\u00a0on Russian gas and LNG imports.\u00a0The\u00a0EU is working on its 16th sanctions package ahead of the third anniversary of Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\nUnanimous vote\u201cThere\u00a0are ongoing conversations\u201d among member states on how to extend sanctions to Russian LNG, a spokesman for the Spanish energy ministry told Montel.\nBut a\u00a0European Commission spokeswoman declined to\u00a0comment on\u00a0whether\u00a0sanctions\u00a0would form part of a roadmap \u2013 to be presented by energy commissioner Dan Jorgensen next month\u00a0\u2013 on phasing\u00a0out Russian fuels. Sanctions\u00a0would be taken unanimously by member states in the\u00a0EU Council, she said.\nUnder the\u00a0RePowerEU\u00a0plan in 2022, the EU set a\u00a0goal to end imports of Russian gas by 2027.\nThe\u00a0EU\u00a0already prohibits the import of coal and seaborne crude oil and refined oil products from Russia in retaliation\u00a0for its war\u00a0on\u00a0Ukraine. However, Brussels has stopped short of imposing direct\u00a0sanctions\u00a0on\u00a0natural gas and\u00a0LNG\u00a0imports from Russia due to the bloc\u2019s reliance\u00a0on\u00a0the fuel.\n\u201cThe problem is that new sources of LNG supply arrive slowly,\u201d Corbeau said, citing delays at\u00a0LNG\u00a0projects like the\u00a018m tonnes (24.6bcm)\u00a0US Golden Pass and Mexico\u2019s 3.25m tonnes\/year Costa Azul, as well as\u00a0in Mozambique.\n\u201cWe might be able to get rid of the\u00a020bcm\u00a0of\u00a0Russian LNG by 2026 or 2027 in a phased manner,\u201d she said, stressing the EU should wait for 2027 to impose full-scale sanctions, once global LNG supplies increase.\nTrump policy\u201cFrom an economic standpoint, it\u2019s very realistic to consider sanctions on Russian gas,\u201d said Ben McWilliams, research fellow at Bruegel think tank,\u00a0as supply security had vastly improved since the 2022 energy crisis.\nHowever, politically, the\u00a0EU Council\u00a0would need to decide\u00a0on sanctions based on\u00a0\u201chow much they want to hurt the Kremlin versus the impact you will have on European consumers\u201d,\u00a0he said.\nCorbeau also saw risks from how Trump would deal with Russian president Vladimir Putin in Ukraine\u00a0peace talks and whether Putin would seek the lifting of\u00a0US sanctions\u00a0or the revival of exports via Ukraine, citing Slovakia and Hungary as potential buyers.\nHowever, the EU\u2019s plans to phase out Russian gas could be used\u00a0as clout\u00a0in future trade talks to buy US LNG amid Trump\u2019s plans to boost exports of the fuel, McWilliams\u00a0said.",
