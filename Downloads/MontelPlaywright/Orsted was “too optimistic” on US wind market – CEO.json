        "subtitle":"(Montel) Orsted\u2019s new CEO said the group had been too optimistic over the prospects for offshore wind in the US, after two prestigious projects cost it\u00a0EUR 4.6bn in impairments over the past two years.",
        "body":"\u201cIt\u00a0is clear that especially our offshore wind investments in the US have proven to be more challenging than we had anticipated in the past,\u201d Rasmus Errboe told media when presenting the group\u2019s financial results for 2024 in Copenhagen.\nThe world\u2019s largest operator of offshore wind posted impairments of DKK 14.1bn (EUR 1.9bn) from its US offshore wind operations for 2024, following\u00a0a DKK 19.9bn impairment from the same business in 2023.\nOrsted currently aims to start power production at its Revolution Wind (704 MW) and Sunrise Wind (924 MW) projects in 2026 and 2027, respectively. However,\u00a0both projects are struggling with supply chain and construction challenges, said Errboe.\nNo guarantees\u201cWe are working hard to minimise the risks, but due to uncertain market conditions and the macroeconomic climate, I cannot give any guarantees [they will be completed],\u201d he said.\nPolitical uncertainty has also increased following Donald\u00a0Trump\u2019s return to the US presidency. Trump has\u00a0publicly said he is opposed to wind power.\n\u201cWe are closely following all relevant political developments and announcements regarding wind energy [in the US],\u201d said Errboe.\nOrsted on Wednesday axed its 2030 renewables targets due to increased uncertainty,\u00a0and Errboe said the group would have to cut 800 jobs to adjust\u00a0to a revised target.\nIts share price was up 5% on Thursday following the announcement, but is still down close to 10% so far this year. \n(EUR 1 = DKK 7.46)",
