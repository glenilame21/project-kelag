        "body":"Imposing such \u201cunjustified\u201d tariffs would be \u201cunlawful and economically counterproductive\u201d, it said in a short statement giving no details on what its reaction might be.\u00a0\nThe European Commission said it had not received any official notification of new US tariffs on EU goods, and that it would \u201cnot respond to broad announcements without details or written clarification.\u201d\nUS President Donald Trump was reported on Sunday as saying he planned to announce on Monday a 25% tariff on all aluminium and steel imports into the country.\nThe EC said that \u201ctariffs are essentially taxes\u201d and that imposing them would increase costs for US citizens and businesses, fuelling inflation.\nThey would also increase economic uncertainty and make global markets less efficient.\nSome analysts have said a US trade war with Europe could threaten the bloc\u2019s transition to a net-zero economy by slowing economic growth.\nOthers think it could speed up the EU\u2019s efforts to safeguard its supply chains for strategic clean energy technologies by encouraging a \u201cmade in Europe\u201d approach.\u00a0\nLast week Trump imposed a 10% tax on Chinese imports, to which China responded with a 15% tax on imports of US coal and LNG.",
