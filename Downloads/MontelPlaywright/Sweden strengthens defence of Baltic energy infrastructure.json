        "subtitle":"(Montel) The Swedish government has asked its army and coastguard to work together to increase maritime surveillance in the Baltic Sea to protect energy infrastructure from further damage.",
        "body":"Sweden has also decided to join Nato\u2019s plans to strengthen its military presence in the region to help protect critical infrastructure, the government said in a statement on Sunday. It seeks more efficient use of resources and sharing of maritime and intelligence information.\nIt comes after the 650 MW Estlink 2 power cable between Finland and Estonia was damaged on 25 December. Nato and its allies have already substantially increased military patrols of critical infrastructure after damage to the Balticconnector pipeline in 2023 and the rupture in 2022 of the Russia-Germany Nord Stream gas pipelines.\n\u201cThe security situation in the Baltic Sea region and in the Baltic Sea inlets has fundamentally changed since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine [in 2022],\u201d said defence minister Pal Jonson.\n\u201cPotential hybrid operations by a foreign power cannot be ruled out and therefore the need for stronger maritime surveillance is important.\u201d\nEnergy minister Ebba Busch wrote on social media site X that security was being increased due to the rise in incidents involving important underwater infrastructure.",
