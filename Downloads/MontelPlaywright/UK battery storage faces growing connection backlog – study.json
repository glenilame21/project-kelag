        "subtitle":"(Montel) A growing number of UK battery energy storage systems (BESS) waiting for a grid connection has prompted concerns that the backlog could stifle buildout and further investment, a new study has warned.",
        "body":"Analysis from Cornwall Insight estimates that the pipeline of BESS projects awaiting connection is now 61 GW \u2013 far above the government\u2019s 2030 target of 30 GW.\u00a0\nBy 2035, Cornwall says, the queue is expected to hit 129 GW \u2013 over four times the required 29 GW expected by this date, raising questions about which projects will move forward and how grid access will be managed.\u00a0\n\u201cSeveral challenges threaten 2030 clean power goals, with the connection queue being a major hurdle,\u201d said James Lomax, analyst at Cornwall.\u00a0\n\u201cGiven the rapid expansion of battery energy storage over and above forecast connections capacity\u2026 it could well be that more than 100 GW of BESS that wants to connect to the network will not get the option to until at least 2035 or even much later,\u201d he added.\n\u201cIf an asset can\u2019t connect to the grid, it simply can\u2019t contribute.\u201d\nPrioritising projectsCurrently, the UK\u2019s battery energy storage capacity of just over 4 GW is well below the 2030 target.\nSome battery projects will be given priority over other connections in the backlog, including those with capacity market contracts (around 14 GW), projects contracted to connect by 2026 (4.5 GW) and those significantly progressed in planning or construction (21.5 GW).\u00a0\n\u201cTo meet the Clean Power 2030 capacity targets, we would need to connect assets to the network on average 2.5 [times] quicker than we have over the past five years,\u201d Cornwall Insight said.",
