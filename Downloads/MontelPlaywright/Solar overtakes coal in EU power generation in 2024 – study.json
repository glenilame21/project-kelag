        "subtitle":"(Montel) Solar energy surpassed coal in the EU\u2019s power sector for the first time in 2024, generating 11% of electricity compared with coal\u2019s 10%, a new study by think tank Ember showed on Thursday.",
        "body":"Wind and solar power continued their rapid growth last year, with wind producing 17% of EU electricity, overtaking gas (16%) for the second consecutive year, it said in its annual review of the European power sector.\nFossil fuel generation fell to an unprecedented low of 29%, from 39% in 2019, with gas declining for the fifth consecutive year.\n\u201cFossil fuels are losing their grip on EU energy,\u201d said Chris Rosslowe, lead author of the report. \u201cWind and solar are pushing coal to the margins and forcing gas into structural decline.\u201d\nEmber said renewables have reduced the EU\u2019s reliance on imported fossil fuels, shielding it from volatile global energy prices. Renewable capacity added since 2019 saved the bloc from importing an extra 92bcm of gas and 55m tonnes of coal, worth EUR 59bn, it said.\nEconomic, political headwindsRenewables progressed last year despite economic and political difficulties as inflation remained above the norm, said Ember, while elections sparked concerns about waning support for the energy transition.\nHowever, \u201cfurther progress cannot be taken for granted,\u201d said Rosslowe, pointing to the need for wind capacity to more than double annually by 2030 compared with 2024 levels.\nRenewables accounted for 47% of EU power generation last year, up from 34% in 2019 when the EU\u2019s green deal was launched. Coal, the EU\u2019s third largest power source in 2019, fell to sixth place, with more than half of EU countries now relying on coal for less than 5% of their power or eliminating it entirely.\nUnshaken by US retreatMeanwhile, the EU remains resolute in its green transition despite US president Donald Trump starting the withdrawal process from the Paris Agreement, the 2015 treaty that aims to limit global warming, Rosslowe told Montel. \n\u201cThe EU\u2019s green transition won\u2019t be slowed by what happens in the US, if anything it will be emboldened,\u201d he said, highlighting solar and wind\u2019s role in reducing reliance on costly fossil fuel imports.\n\u201cThe US retreat from climate leadership creates an opportunity for the EU to step up and opens the door for more clean technology investments to flow into Europe.\u201d\nLobby SolarPower Europe hailed the EU\u2019s renewables \u201cmilestone\u201d.\n\u201cThis milestone is not just climate action but a cornerstone of European energy security and industrial competitiveness,\u201d said CEO Walburga Hemetsberger, calling for more storage buildout and smart electrification in heating, transport and industry.",
