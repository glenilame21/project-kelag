        "subtitle":"(Montel) Northwest Europe\u2019s front-month LNG price closed\u00a0at a two-year high on Thursday on colder forecasts and falling stocks, while Chinese competition for the liquid fuel emerged in Asia amid the tariff spat with the US.",
        "body":"The landing price for LNG delivered ex-ship to northwest Europe in March gained USD 0.22 to settle at USD 16.01\/MMbtu (EUR 52.73\/MWh), its\u00a0highest since 2 February 2023, according to Spark Commodities data.\nThat is 20% higher than the\u00a0year-to-date low reached\u00a0on 10 January, but prices have been on an upward trend for around a year.\nEuropean LNG prices track the continent\u2019s benchmark front-month TTF gas contract, which\u00a0also closed\u00a0at a two-year high yesterday of EUR 54.50\/MWh (USD 16.55\/MMbtu), amid colder forecasts and falling storage, participants said.\n\u201cEuropean gas prices rose as the uncertain supply outlook meets with a looming cold snap expected in the northwest in coming days that will lift heating demand and draw on fuel stockpiles,\u201d said a note from analysts at Australian bank ANZ.\nCompetition for supplySpot competition is also emerging in Asia, despite low demand, especially as Chinese buyers seek to replace US LNG cargoes, which had\u00a0a 15% import tax attached to them this week.\n\u201cThe 15% tariff that China placed on US LNG imports has prompted Chinese buyers to enquire about selling US shipments. Those same buyers are also looking at how they can replace those LNG cargoes from other parts of Asia,\u201d wrote ANZ.\nColder weather forecasts in Asia are also driving up spot demand, while there are ongoing small disruptions to supply, participants said.\nEuropean buyers will also have to compete with Egypt, which is seeking more LNG this year on top of recent supply deals with Shell and TotalEnergies, said ANZ.\nMeanwhile, Asia\u2019s LNG price for March in the JKM was last seen up USD 0.09 to almost USD 14.52\/MMbtu, its highest in almost two months.\nAs such, the TTF premium on the JKM equivalent for March remains at around USD 2, easily allowing Europe to attract available spot LNG.",
