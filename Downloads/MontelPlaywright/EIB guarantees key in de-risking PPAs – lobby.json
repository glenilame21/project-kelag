        "body":"\u201cAdequate guarantee schemes can reduce the market barriers which prevent industrial consumers from signing PPAs, while ensuring effective price signals remain on the electricity market,\u201d\u00a0the power lobby said\u00a0in a paper calling for an EU\u00a0electrification\u00a0bank.\nIt called on the EIB to give budget guarantees to underpin PPAs with industrial users, and to help national governments take similar measures.\nThe EIB is talking to the European Commission about a product designed to de-risk PPAs by protecting against credit default by\u00a0offtakers,\u00a0EIB\u00a0principal energy economist Manuel Baritaud said last month, without giving\u00a0further\u00a0details.\nThe EC sees PPAs as one way to protect industrial consumers from the recent power price volatility driven by price-setting gas-fired power plants, while also giving renewable developers stable long-term cash flows that help new projects secure private capital financing. \u00a0\nElectrification\u00a0bankEurelectric called for the EU to set up an\u00a0electrification\u00a0bank as a\u00a0one-stop shop\u00a0to help industry decarbonise, as the bloc pursues its goal of having\u00a0a net-zero economy by 2050.\nThis should be \u201ca central pillar\u201d of the EU electrification action plan the EC intends to unveil early next year.\nThe aim\u00a0of such a \u201cbank\u201d would be\u00a0to bring existing and new EU and national funding opportunities to help industry switch from using fossil fuels to clean electricity together under a single, simplified access process managed by the EC. \u00a0\nProjects applying for support to decarbonise via electrification could commit to signing a PPA for part of their power supply, said Eurelectric.\nApplications from the entire European Economic Area \u2013 which includes Norway \u2013 should be eligible to avoid distorting the internal power market.\nEurelectric called for the EIB to be closely involved with the EC in vetting and monitoring such projects, and in designing funding and de-risking instruments. This could include equity investments or loans, as well as budget guarantees.\nETS revenuesThe EU\u2019s emissions trading system (ETS) could be an important funding source to help industry decarbonise, said Eurelectric.\nIt called for \u201ca significant portion\u201d of the revenues national governments receive directly from auctioning EU ETS allowances to be used for this.
