        "subtitle":"(Montel) Romania looked set to surpass its national target of 9.9 GW of solar generation capacity by 2030, driven largely by rooftop installations, the Romanian Photovoltaic Industry Association has said.",
        "body":"The country\u2019s energy and climate plan target has targeted 3.5 GW in rooftop solar installations, \u201ca goal that will be surpassed in the next one to two years\u201d, the solar lobby said late on Friday.\nRomania\u2019s solar sector grew from 3 GW at the end of 2023 to 5 GW at the end of 2024, mainly thanks to incentives to help households install rooftop panels. Around 200,000 households contributed to 64% of annual installations, according to a report by SolarPower Europe, another lobby.\nThe number of utility-scale projects in the pipelines grew by around 23% compared to 2023, driven by a recently concluded contract for difference tender and significant EU funding.\nHowever, the Romanian solar lobby warns that despite the progress, the solar sector faces hurdles such as grid connections bottlenecks and a limited number of offtakers to secure power purchase agreements.\nThe lobby also fears that the upcoming grid capacity auction system for projects over 5 MW due to start in 2026 may add complexity to project timelines. Romania\u2019s TSO has yet to provide details about implementing procedures.",
