        "subtitle":"(Montel) Europe\u2019s industrial sector needs substantial near-term aid to weather current high gas prices, stemming from tight supply \u2013 with only five years left to save some industries, the head of metals industry lobby Eurometaux told Montel.",
        "body":"\u201cIf the price of gas remains at this high level of EUR 40-50\/MWh, we will need to have very specific support\u00a0[for operating costs]\u00a0or we won\u2019t be able to remain competitive,\u201d said James Watson, Eurometaux director general.\u00a0\n\u201cThere\u2019s no market fundamental or market analysis that says gas and power prices will return to a competitive level in Europe anytime soon. The European Commission knows that.\"\n\u201cWhether we like it or not, we need to recognise this reality and support industries until the market eases.\u201d\nHe stressed the\u00a0need for harmonised aid to help industrials evenly across the bloc. \u00a0\n\u201cWe have probably about five years to save the majority of those industries that are really exposed to international competition and high energy prices,\u201d he said.\nThe EC is expected to unveil its\u00a0affordable energy action plan\u00a0on 26 February to tackle high energy prices, along with its\u00a0clean industrial deal\u00a0intended to keep manufacturing in Europe while decarbonising it.\u00a0\nEurope\u2019s metals industry, represented by Eurometaux, uses electricity for 60% of its\u00a0energy needs. However, electricity prices remain heavily influenced by the cost of gas.\nWatson\u00a0said gas prices were unlikely to\u00a0drop significantly before mid-2027, when new supply enters the market.\nUrgent support neededThe affordable energy action plan may propose more favourable taxes, levies and tariff methodologies, Watson said.\n\u201cBut a lot of that is left to the member states in the end. This takes time and it won\u2019t be uniform across the EU,\u201d he warned.\nThe only way the clean industrial deal could provide immediate help in keeping factories open would be through state aid to strategic industries under the Critical Raw Materials Act or the\u00a0Net-Zero\u00a0Industry Act, Watson said.",
