        "body":"\u201cHeavy depletion of gas storage could lead to a substantial need for action to refill to meet the legal gas storage targets,\u201d said Ines managing director Sebastian Heinermann in a statement.\nIf winter temperatures remained at average levels, storage levels should fall from roughly 70% currently to 49% by the end of March but in the event of cold weather it could see capacity as low as 24%, said Ines.\nThe EU has a regulatory target that gas storage is filled to 90% of capacity by early November, though the lobby group said there was little incentive to refill storage after the winter.\nAuctions urged\u201cInes recommends an early start of refilling activities, partly via tenders,\u201d said Heinermann, with Germany last resorting to auctions to inject gas into storage in the wake of the Ukraine war in 2022 and its impact on the energy market.\nPrices currently offered little incentive to inject since the summer contract on the benchmark Dutch TTF gas hub was currently trading at a near EUR 3 premium to its winter counterpart.\nGermany has the largest gas storage capacity in the EU with a total of 251.5 TWh, equal to roughly 30% of the country\u2019s gas demand in 2024.\nThe EU introduced the storage targets due to the war and subsequent Russian gas delivery cuts to Europe.",
