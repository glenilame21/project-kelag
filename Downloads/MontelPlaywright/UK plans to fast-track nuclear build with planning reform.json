        "subtitle":"(Montel) The UK government on Thursday announced plans to expedite the construction of nuclear power plants across England and Wales by stripping back planning regulations to facilitate the development of small modular reactors (SMRs).",
        "body":"A press release from\u00a0the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said\u00a0that regarding nuclear power, \u201cfor too long the country has been mired by delay and obstruction, with a system too happy to label decisions as too difficult, or too long term\u201d.\nIt noted that no new nuclear power plants have been built since 1995 and that\u00a0only one \u2013 Hinkley Point C \u2013 is currently under construction, \u201cleaving the UK lagging behind in a global race to harness cleaner, more affordable energy\u201d.\nNew groundThe statement notes that nuclear development is currently\u00a0restricted to eight sites, as a result of \u201carchaic planning rules that haven\u2019t been looked at since 2011\u201d.\nThe reforms announced today include \u201cscrapping the set list of 8 sites\u201d, \u201cremoving the expiry date on nuclear planning rules\u201d and \u201csetting up a Nuclear Regulatory Taskforce\u201d.\n\u201cThe refreshed planning framework will help streamline the process to encourage investment and enable developers to identify the best sites for their projects, supporting development at a wider range of locations,\u201d the statement said.\nPart of the government\u2019s wider Plan For Change, the reforms also include a proposal that\u00a0small and advanced modular reactors be built in the UK for the first time.\u00a0\nSMRs would be integrated\u00a0into existing planning frameworks, allowing for their construction in various locations, including those that can support energy-intensive infrastructure such as AI data centres.\u00a0\n\u201cStrongest signal\u201dTom Greatrex, chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, told Montel that the proposal was \u201cthe strongest signal yet that new nuclear is critical to the growth and clean power mission\u201d.\u00a0\n\u201cA more streamlined planning system will give certainty to investors, the supply chain and communities, and will enable us to get on with building new nuclear plants on more sites and at pace for a cleaner, more secure power system,\u201d he added.\nThe UK currently has around 6.5 GW of installed nuclear capacity.",
