        "subtitle":"(Montel) LSEG expects Spain\u2019s wholesale power market to see around 900 hours of near-zero and negative prices this year, up by 15% from 784 hours in 2024, senior analyst Margarita Flores told Montel.",
        "body":"The number of hours with negative prices will increase by 22% to around 300 this year from 247 in 2024, when negative prices started to be seen in Spain, Flores said in an interview for Montel\u2019s Energia al Dia podcast. \nMontel Analytics data also points to an increase in the number of hours with low power prices in 2025, amid a sustained increase in green capacity and restrictions on exports to the rest of Europe. \nIn an interview at the E-World energy fair in Essen, Germany, Flores forecast that Spain would continue to see a high number of negative-price hours in 2026, and that they may ease in 2027.\nThe negative price trend in Spain was a result of a lack of flexibility, said Flores. However, this could improve with the addition of increased battery storage and the construction of a new 2.2 GW interconnection with France by 2028, the analyst said. \nNuclear phaseoutMeanwhile, Spain will see \u201cno risks to the security of supply\u201d due to the scheduled nuclear phaseout between 2027-35, the analyst said.\nThe country had a \u201cvery good combination\u201d of renewables and gas-fired capacity, and its gas-fired plants \u2013 which have a combined capacity of 25 GW \u2013 would be \u201ckey\u201d to providing flexibility to the system when the 7 GW nuclear fleet closed, Flores said.\nThis analysis differed from some others, which have forecast spiralling power prices and security of supply risks in Spain after the nuclear phaseout. \nDemand on the riseAs for consumption, Flores predicted that Spanish power demand will accelerate in 2025 to grow by 2.6%, up from the 1.2% growth rate seen in 2024.\nThis could intensify to an annual rate of 3-4%, given increased consumption from electric vehicles and heating electrification, she added.\nDemand was also set to jump thanks to new electrolysers, data centres and mega-factories, as power prices in Spain and Portugal were likely to average 20% below those in other European neighbours, Flores said.\nSpanish demand could average around 283 TWh in 2030, 13% above its 2019 level but still well below the 34% increase forecast in Spain\u2019s national energy and climate plan, the analyst said. \nThe interview with Margarita Flores is available in Spanish in the latest episode of Montel\u2019s Energia al Dia podcast.",
