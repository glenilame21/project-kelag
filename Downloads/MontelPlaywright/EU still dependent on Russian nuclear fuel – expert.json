        "subtitle":"(Montel) Around 20% of the EU\u2019s nuclear reactors remain dependent on Russia for their fuel supplies, independent nuclear expert Mycle Schneider said on Thursday.",
        "body":"Of the EU\u2019s 101 reactors, 19 are Soviet-designed VVER pressurized water reactors that still depend on fuels and services\u00a0provided by Russian-owned businesses, Schneider said in a presentation\u00a0of\u00a0the latest edition of the World Nuclear Industry Status Report, which is produced by a group of independent experts.\nWhile this only amounted to a fifth of the bloc\u2019s reactors, \u201ctheir dependence level is fairly high\u201d, he told Montel, noting that there was lack of transparency over Russian fuel dependency.\u00a0\nSchneider said that 23% of the\u00a0uranium imported into the EU in 2023 came from Russia, up from 20% in 2021, despite the outbreak of the war in Ukraine.\u00a0\nThis was \u201cvery much linked to stockpiling because the operators feared there might be sanctions on the nuclear sector,\u201d he said.\u00a0\nSchneider said that countries such as Slovakia and Hungary had a \u201cdouble dependency\u201d.\n\u201cThey have a high dependency on nuclear and nuclear has a high dependency on Russian fuel,\u201d he added.\nRoadmapEnergy\u00a0commissioner Dan Jorgensen is expected to present a roadmap on\u00a026\u00a0March on how to phase out Russian fossil fuels. Jorgensen said in December that nuclear fuels would\u00a0also\u00a0be covered by\u00a0the\u00a0roadmap.\u00a0\nThe nuclear industry\u00a0has so far been almost completely untouched by the previous 15 rounds of sanction packages introduced by the EU on Russia.\u00a0\nThe only exception was in February 2023, when the bloc \u2013 along with the US, the UK and Canada \u2013 targeted Atomflot,\u00a0which maintains Russia\u2019s nuclear icebreaker fleet.\nThe EU has been considering duties instead of sanctions on nuclear products, according to the report. \u201cApplying duties does not require a unanimous decision\u00a0[by all member states],\u201d\u00a0it\u00a0said,\u00a0noting that duties would not solve the EU\u2019s underlying dependency on Russian supply.",
