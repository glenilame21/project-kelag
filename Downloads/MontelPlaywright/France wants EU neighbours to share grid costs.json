        "subtitle":"(Montel) France wants to involve neighbouring countries in financing grid costs due to an increase in cross-border power flows, said Sophie Mourlon, director general for energy and climate at the French economy ministry.",
        "body":"\u201cFrance is in a very special situation in the west of the European Union, we are in a transition territory for electricity,\u201d Mourlon told the Franco-German Energy Forum on Wednesday.\nShe referred to France as a \u201ctransit country\u201d for renewable electricity, despite its large fleet of nuclear power plants, and cited the transmission of solar power from Spain as an example.\n\u201cThere are more and more electricity flows through France,\u201d Mourlon said. While there were also moments when France imports and exports, \u201ca lot also goes through the grid in France.\u201d\nShe said that while EU member states determine their energy mix, they should coordinate more at an EU-wide level regarding planning and costs.\nFrance would provide the infrastructure to promote power exchange at a European level, she said. \u201cThese are costs that those who benefit from it will also have to bear.\u201d\n\u201cAs I said, we are a transit country, and we need to discuss with our neighbours and the European Union how the costs can be fairly distributed,\u201d Mourlon said.",
