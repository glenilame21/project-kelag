        "subtitle":"(Montel) French power generation reached a five-year high of 536.5 TWh last year amid a recovery in nuclear and hydropower output and sustained growth in solar and wind production, TSO RTE said on Monday.",
        "body":"Atomic output reached 361.7 TWh, up from 320.4 TWh in 2023 and 279 TWh in 2022, which was a 30-year low.\nHydropower generation hit 74.7 TWh, its highest level since 2013. Solar and wind generated 70 TWh, down from 72.4 TWh in 2023 and up from 46 TWh in 2019, RTE said. In total, renewables covered more than a quarter (27.6%) of France\u2019s total power output last year.\nMeanwhile, fossil-fired generation fell to its lowest level since the early 1950s, at 19.9 TWh, with gas-fired plants produced 17.4 TWh compared with 29.2 TWh the year before. Output from coal-fired (0.7 TWh) and oil-fired (1.8 TWh) plants \u201cremained low\u201d, the TSO said.\nLower fossil need?The annual figures showed that nuclear and renewable energies could be \u201cdeveloped together\u201d while reducing the need for fossil-fired generation in France and Europe, Thomas Veyrenc, the TSO\u2019s head of forecasting and strategy, said on social media site Linked in.\nHe said also that France remained 60% dependent on imported fossil fuels.\u00a0\nThe surge in output amid sluggish demand pushed French power exports to a 22-year high, Montel reported earlier this month. \nFrench utility EDF expected to generate 358-364 TWh of atomic output in 2024, it said last month.",
