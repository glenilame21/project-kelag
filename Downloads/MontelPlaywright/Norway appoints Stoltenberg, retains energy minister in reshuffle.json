        "subtitle":"(Montel) Former Norwegian prime minister Jens Stoltenberg has made a surprise return to the frontline of the country\u2019s politics as finance minister, prime minister Jonas Gahr Store announced on Tuesday, as he retained Terje Aasland as energy minister.",
        "body":"Store announced eight new ministers today after his Labour party\u2019s coalition government with the anti-EU Centre party collapsed last week in a row over EU energy policies, leaving Labour to govern alone until the September general election.\nStoltenberg led Nato for a decade until last year, where he was known for building a good relationship with Donald Trump during his first term as US president. His return to the front benches comes at a time when Norway faces the risk of tariffs from Trump in his second term.\nHe served as prime minster from 2000-2001 and between 2005-2013 and has also previously been both finance minister and energy minister.",
