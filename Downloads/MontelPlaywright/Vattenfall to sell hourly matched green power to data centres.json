        "subtitle":"(Montel) Swedish utility Vattenfall has agreed with data centre operator Digital Realty to sell it renewable power that is matched every hour with electricity demand, the companies said on Wednesday.",
        "body":"The agreement will cover six data centres.\nPernille Hoffmann, managing director Nordics at Stockholm-based Digital Realty, told Montel that 24\/7 matching involved a higher cost than buying guarantees of origin with annual matching.\n\u201cIt requires a combination of several renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar and hydropower, to match actual usage in real time. Prices vary depending on demand and availability of renewable energy, which means costs can fluctuate,\u201d said Hoffmann.\nThe power demand of the data centres was not disclosed.",
