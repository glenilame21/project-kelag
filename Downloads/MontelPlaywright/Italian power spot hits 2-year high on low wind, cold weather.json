        "subtitle":"(Montel) Italian spot power prices for Monday surged to a two-year high of close to EUR 193\/MWh, driven by low wind output in Germany and forecasted below-average temperatures across Europe, a trader said.",
        "body":"\u201cWhenever there is a drop in wind production in Germany, it unfortunately creates a problem across Europe, including Italy,\u201d Diego Pellegrino, trader and CEO at Eroga Energia, told Montel.\nMonday baseload settled at EUR 192.84\/MWh,\u00a0its highest\u00a0since January 2023\u00a0and up by\u00a0EUR 48.22, or 33%, on the day. Meanwhile, the spot for Tuesday settled at EUR 163.35\/MWh on Monday.\u00a0\nTurning colderTemperatures\u00a0are also contributing to the price increase,\u00a0Pellegrino\u00a0noted.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a cold winter, but temperatures are lower compared to the last two years, which were warm,\u201d Pellegrino added, noting that household gas consumption\u00a0in particular is\u00a0driving demand.\nTraders expected temperatures to fall 4-6C below the European average by the end of January and began pricing this into the market at least two weeks in advance.\n\u201cWe have to accept that, unfortunately, we have great volatility at the European level,\u201d Pellegrino said. He also noted that\u00a0the fact that gas sets the price in the marginal price system continues to be a factor driving prices up.\nIn 2024, non-renewable\u00a0generation met\u00a042% of Italy\u2019s electricity demand, while renewables covered a record high\u00a041%.\nThe front-month gas contract on the benchmark Dutch TTF hub was last seen trading around EUR 46\/MWh.",
