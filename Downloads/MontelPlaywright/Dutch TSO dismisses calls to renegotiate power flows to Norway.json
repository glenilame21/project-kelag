        "subtitle":"(Montel) Dutch TSO Tennet has dismissed calls from politicians in Norway to\u00a0renegotiate deals that regulate\u00a0cross-border interconnector power flows between Norway and the rest of Europe.",
        "body":"\u201cActual power flows are not subject to bilateral contractual agreements between TSOs,\u201d Tennet spokesman Peter Hofland told Montel. Tennet is the co-owner of\u00a0the power links from Norway to the Netherlands (700 MW) and Germany (1,400 MW).\nSeveral opposition parties in Norway, including the Centre party that left government last week, have called for renegotiations that will allow the country\u00a0to reduce export capacity in periods of high prices or low hydropower reservoir levels. \nHowever,\u00a0such deals were outside the scope of the TSOs, said Hofland, noting that all three countries were part of the EU\u2019s\u00a0internal energy market where flows are decided by \u00a0the\u00a0day-ahead and intraday markets.\n\u201cThese projects are based on multilateral agreements between TSOs and nominated electricity market operators in Europe,\u201d\u00a0said Hofland. \u201cThe\u00a0power flows on specific interconnectors are not subject to negotiated agreements between selected parties.\u201d\nDifficult to terminateNorwegian energy minister Terje Aasland told Montel that\u00a0it was very difficult to terminate the deals that determine how interconnectors operate, as they were private law agreements between the TSOs.\n\u201cI do not have any authority to terminate these cable contracts. But I have told Statnett that they had to make adjustments to the NSL cable [to the UK] at a time when there was asymmetry in the power capacity on each side,\u201d Aasland told Montel.\nHe referred to an incident in March 2023, when Norway\u2019s government ordered Statnett to cut available capacity on the NSL from 1.4 GW to 1.1 GW in both directions for an indefinite period, because National Grid was unable to provide full export capacity on the cable towards Norway.\nNational Grid told Montel that the company was working closely with Statnett, as well as with the governments of the UK and Norway.",
