        "subtitle":"(Montel) Europe\u2019s strategic errors on natural gas, nuclear and solar policies have left its industry facing a major energy cost gap compared with global rivals, said International Energy Agency executive director Fatih Birol on Wednesday.",
        "body":"\u201cOver-reliance on gas from a single country, dropping the ball on solar energy and turning our back on nuclear power in Europe were key strategic mistakes,\u201d he told a Financial Times event in Brussels.\nThe EU used to import nearly half its gas from Russia\u00a0before supply dwindled after Moscow\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine and the\u00a0Nord Stream\u00a0explosions in September that year, pushing EU energy prices to record highs\u00a0and the bloc to turn to other energy sources, mainly US LNG.\nThe mistake was relying so much on a single source, not Russia specifically, said Birol. \u201cIt could have been any country.\u201d\nNuclear challengeHe also berated Europe for losing its global leadership in solar energy manufacturing to China. It was too late to regain it in solar, but he saw potential for Europe to be a global industrial leader in areas such as batteries, wind and\u00a0grid development.\nBirol noted that\u00a0EU governments\u2019 decisions \u2013 particularly in Germany \u2013 to move away from nuclear power was before the bloc realised it would need more low-carbon, affordable, reliable baseload power to meet its climate and industrial competitiveness goals.\nAt the same time, Europe\u2019s few new nuclear projects\u00a0in the UK, France and Finland\u00a0had on average taken up to 10 years longer to complete and been more than twice as expensive than planned,\u00a0he added.\nHe said he saw\u00a0renewables as the major element in the EU\u2019s future energy mix, but nuclear still had a role, particularly through lifetime extensions for existing plants.\nNew nuclear plants, however, would likely need government support via some kind of long-term revenue guarantees to be viable, and a \u201cmore disciplined\u201d nuclear industry, he said.\nThe European Commission\u00a0has pledged to\u00a0lower energy prices for industry to help it remain competitive in the global market as the EU continues to decarbonise.",
