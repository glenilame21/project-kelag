        "body":"The front-month contract for Brent crude North Sea oil was last seen down USD 0.60 at USD 74.58\/bbl, while the WTI equivalent was USD 0.58 lower at USD 70.79\/bbl.\n\u201cCrude oil prices slumped following reports that Russia and the US were in talks to end the war in Ukraine,\u201d said Australia\u2019s ANZ bank in a note.\n\u201cUS president Donald Trump called Russian president Vladimir Putin, sparking optimism that risks to crude oil supplies would ease. The leaders agreed to begin talks to end the war.\u201d\n\u201cImmediate negotiations\u201dIn a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump said he and the Russian president had \u201cagreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately\u201d.\n\u201cSigns of tightening supplies have been pushing up oil prices in recent weeks,\u201d said ANZ.\n\u201cUS sanctions on Russian oil companies and vessels are said to have exacerbated the situation,\u201d it added, with the previous administration in Washington having brought in the curbs to stop Moscow funding its war via petrodollars.\n\u201cRussia\u2019s oil output has subsequently fallen to 8.9m bbl\/day, 16,000 bbl\/day below its approved levels under the Opec+ production agreement.\u201d\nSentiment was also not helped by a broader \u201crisk-off tone\u201d across the market, with a weak global economy compounded by concerns about the erratic tariff policy of the new US administration, which could further dent growth, said ANZ.\nMarket in surplusIn the medium term, meanwhile, Sweden\u2019s SEB bank cited a forecast from the US Energy Information Administration that predicted a \u201csurplus market with prices sliding lower assuming Opec+ lifts production\u201d.\nAfter implementing significant output cuts since late 2022 to inflate prices, the producer cartel has announced plans to gradually reverse these cuts starting in April.\nHowever, given the projections the \u201cjob of Opec+ is getting more difficult with no room to lift production from its January level if it wants to avoid rising inventories and lower prices\u201d, said SEB.",
