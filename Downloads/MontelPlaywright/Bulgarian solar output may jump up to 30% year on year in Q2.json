        "subtitle":"(Montel) Solar energy may jump up to 29% on the year in the second quarter of 2025 as TSO Eso said output is set to account for 60-70% of total electricity production during certain hours of the day.",
        "body":"This compares with a 41% share of solar in Bulgaria\u2019s power mix during the peak hours between 11:00-14:00 local time during Q2 2024, with the highest level recorded at 58%, according to data from Montel Analytics.\nBulgaria has significantly increased its solar capacity in recent years, installing around 3 GW of solar since the beginning of 2022, said Andrea Ljubljanac, commercial market analyst at Montel Analytics.\nThe total installed capacity of solar power plants is expected to further rise to 5 GW at the end of Q2 from around 3.8 GW at the same time last year, Eso told Montel on Monday.\nIn spring 2024, \u201csolar plants accounted for 17.7% of the total electricity generated in the country\u201d, it said.\nSince the beginning of this year, solar has made up 25% of Bulgaria\u2019s power mix during peak hours, with a high of 38.7%, according to Montel Analytics data.\nThe rise in solar generation may make it challenging for the TSO to maintain system services such as voltage regulation and stability reserves, Dimitar Zarchev, manager at ESO, said at an industry event organised by Bulgaria\u2019s green energy association APSTE in Sofia on Friday.\nHowever, he said the process would be eased by the addition of battery storage, as well as the balancing mechanism introduced by regulator EWRC in May last year.\n\u201cUrgent\u201d need for windDespite the rise of solar, APSTE\u2019s chairman Nikola Gazdov warned that no new wind farms have been built in a decade due to bureaucratic obstacles and lack of public acceptance.\n\u201cBulgaria urgently needs new wind power plants to secure affordable electricity even when the sun isn\u2019t shining,\u201d he said.\nBulgaria last month updated its national energy and climate plan (NECP), targeting up to 12.3 GW of renewable production by 2030, with the biggest growth expected in its solar generation. The plan targets 2 GW onshore wind capacity by 2030.\nThe country plans at least 3 GWh of battery storage and 1.6 GW of pumped hydropower storage by 2032.",
