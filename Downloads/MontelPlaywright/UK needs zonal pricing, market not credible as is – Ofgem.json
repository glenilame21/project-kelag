        "subtitle":"(Montel) A shift to zonal power pricing is the best option for Britain, not least because of the anticipated boom in AI-driven data centre demand, Jonathan Brearley, CEO of regulator Ofgem told Montel\u2019s Plugged In podcast on Friday.",
        "body":"\u201cWith the amount of change that\u2019s in this sector, the idea we leave this market as it is, I don\u2019t think is credible.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a robust debate within Ofgem [and] we have come to the view that zonal pricing is the best way forward. It\u2019s not a unanimous view but by and large we think that is the best way to create a system that\u2019s adaptable,\u201d he said.\nConsidering splitThe UK government is considering a shift from a national wholesale market price to splitting the country into at least six pricing zones as part of its current review of electricity market arrangements.\nDoing so would allow industrial consumers, including data centres, to locate to areas with plenty of wind generation, for example, allowing them to access cheaper electricity, Brearley said.\n\u201c[It\u2019s a] big debate within Ofgem. Not finalised but we think it\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d he said.\nBrearley likened the contentious discussion around zonal pricing to the government\u2019s contracts for difference subsidy scheme, which had faced similar resistance within industry initially, before going on to score significant success, namely the drastic reduction in prices for offshore wind.\n\u201cPeople told me at the time this was too disruptive and this wasn\u2019t going to be good for investment and it drove a huge increase in investment. All my experience suggests that when you set clear goals, when you work with the industry properly, that you can achieve far more than you imagine you can,\u201d he said.\nUtility viewMeanwhile, Greg Jackson, CEO of UK utility Octopus Energy, has openly backed zonal pricing, saying it would attract energy-intensive industry to areas with the cheapest electricity prices.\nBut Alistair Phillips-Davies, CEO of rival SSE, holds a different view.\n\u201cPersonally, I\u2019m baffled as to why we\u2019re having a discussion about zonal pricing,\u201d he told the BBC\u2019s Today programme this week.\n\u201cZonal pricing is a postcode lottery for both people looking to build massive new infrastructure and work out what their costs might be,\u201d he said, warning consumers would also face \u201cpossibly huge differential prices\u201d across the country.\n\u201cWhat we need to do is get zonal dismissed.\u201d\nThe UK government is widely expected to take a decision on whether to move to zonal pricing by June.\nThe Nordic region, for example, has such a mechanism, which observers say can more efficiently match local supply and demand, leading to more competitive power prices.\nListen to the Plugged In podcast here.",
