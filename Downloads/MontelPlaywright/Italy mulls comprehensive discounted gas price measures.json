        "subtitle":"(Montel) Italy\u00a0is considering\u00a0expanding its discounted gas price mechanism beyond hard-to-abate industry to also mitigate the impact\u00a0of soaring bills on households, the energy minister said\u00a0on Monday.",
        "body":"\u201cWe may need temporary measures similar to those introduced for major electricity users with the\u00a0\u2018energy release\u2019 [programme]\u00a0that benefitted some 4,000 industrial users across the nation,\u201d Gilberto Pichetto Fratin said in a radio interview.\u00a0\n\u201cWe now need to think about energy-intensive gas users, though if prices don\u2019t decrease, we must also intervene on overall gas prices which affect everyone, including residential users.\u201d\nThe Italian government\u00a0introduced\u00a0a \u201cgas release\u201d programme to support energy-intensive industries, such as chemicals, paper, ceramics and cement, by allocating domestically produced gas at regulated prices.\nPichetto Fratin\u00a0also said he had asked the European Commission to cap gas prices\u00a0on European markets.\n\u201cIf the EU even just threatens a price cap, it would limit speculation,\u201d he said, without providing information on levels at which the cap should be introduced, or if the EC was considering the measure.\nLast month, the European Commission said it would not propose extending a gas price cap mechanism introduced in 2022 and which expired on 31 January.\nDeclining gas storage levelsThe energy minister also expressed\u00a0concern over the effects soaring prices would have on Italy\u2019s need to\u00a0replenish\u00a0its gas storage facilities after the winter.\u00a0\nTypically, gas injections are carried out between April and October, with the first auctions held in early April, and gas is withdrawn during winter months when demand peaks. However,\u00a0Pichetto Fratin\u00a0said he had already ordered the first refills.\nIn January, he said Italy was considering bringing forward some of the gas storage auctions to help safeguard consumers from potential price spikes.\n\u201cWe have fairly good storage levels, but we are drawing them down and will need to replenish them,\u201d\u00a0the minister said. \u201cBuying at above the EUR MWh we paid at the time of filling becomes a serious problem.\u201d\nItalian storage levels are currently at 62.7% compared to the European average of 53.1%. Italy\u2019s PSV\u00a0spot\u00a0is trading at EUR 54.4\/MWh, in line with its summer contract which is currently being exchanged at EUR 54.5\/MWh.\n\u201cThis weighs on us much more because we are very dependent on gas for thermal power stations\u2019 generation,\u201d\u00a0Pichetto Fratin\u00a0said, adding that power demand was expected to \u201cexplode\u201d in coming years.\nItaly relies heavily on gas, which fuels nearly half of the country\u2019s electricity generation, with gas imports exceeding 90% of total consumption.",
