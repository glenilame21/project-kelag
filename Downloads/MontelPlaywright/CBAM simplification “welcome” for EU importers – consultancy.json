        "subtitle":"(Montel) A simplification of the EU carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) through the raising of the threshold for inclusion is likely to be a \u201cwelcome\u201d change for thousands of importers, according to UK consultancy Redshaw Advisors.",
        "body":"Over 80% of EU companies eligible for\u00a0the\u00a0CBAM will be exempted under reforms planned by the European Commission, EU commissioner Wopke Hoekstra was reported as saying in a Financial Times article on Thursday.\n\u201cWhat we have found is that roughly 20% or less [of\u00a0firms\u00a0covered by\u00a0CBAM] are responsible for 97% of all the emissions,\u201d he\u00a0told\u00a0the European Parliament\u2019s tax committee on Thursday.\nInclusion\u00a0thresholdThe value threshold for CBAM inclusion is currently set at EUR 150\u00a0for\u00a0imported and covered goods, which include electricity, iron and steel, aluminium, hydrogen, fertilisers and cement.\u00a0\nCurrent rules foresee 200,000 importers being impacted by a large administrative burden, which many\u00a0considered disproportionate\u00a0to the carbon impact of relatively small\u00a0quantities of\u00a0goods, said Dan Maleski, senior environmental markets advisor at Redshaw Advisors.\n\u201cThe change will be a welcome development for thousands of importers considering the substantial administrative burden that the lower threshold placed on smaller importers amidst a struggling EU economy that is also in the crosshairs of Trump\u2019s tariffs,\u201d he said.\nRaising the de minimis threshold would be an \u201cobvious and easy win for the EU\u201d\u00a0following recent calls by\u00a0the European People\u2019s Party (EPP) for a two-year delay in EU CBAM implementation, and later\u00a0for a simplification, according to Maleski.\nThe EC\u2019s latest plans \u201cessentially [confirm] that the EPP\u2019s calls for the\u2026\u00a0start date to be delayed will be rejected,\u201d said Maleski.\nThe proposed change would bring the EU CBAM more into line with the UK equivalent, which is set to be\u00a0launched in 2027\u00a0and\u00a0has a significantly higher de minimis threshold of GBP 50,000.\nSimplificationCBAM simplification is inevitable,\u00a0according to Simon Goess, co-founder and managing director at German consultancy Carboneer.\nThe question\u00a0is whether they will address \u201cthe environmental and carbon leakage concerns associated with the end of free allocations in the EU ETS\u201d, he said.\n\u201cThe most [sensible] metric to determine simplifications would be in terms of imported volume, as this is directly related to imported emissions.\u201d\nThe EC plans to present its ideas for simplifying selected EU legislation, including\u00a0CBAM, on 26 February, along with a clean industrial deal strategy and an affordable energy action plan.\nA separate review by the EC later this year will look at expanding\u00a0CBAM\u2019s scope to include more industrial sectors and downstream products, as well as possible measures on exports.",
