        "subtitle":"(Montel) Solar photovoltaic has become the renewable technology with the most installed capacity in Spain, surpassing wind for the first time, TSO Red Electrica said on Tuesday.",
        "body":"Spain\u2019s solar fleet has reached 32,043 MW, ahead of the 32,007 MW of wind, to represent almost 25% of the country\u2019s total installed power, it added in a statement.\nThe solar figure was found to be higher than provisional January TSO data released on Monday.\n\u201cWith the new photovoltaic solar megawatts that came online, 66% of the generation fleet in Spain is made up of renewable technologies, a fact that shows the progress of the energy transition,\u201d said the TSO.\nSpain connected 7.7 GW of renewable capacity last year, of which 6.7 GW was photovoltaic solar.\nSolar panels hit a production record in Spain last year with 44.5 TWh, or 17% of the total, the TSO said.\nThe technology produced 9.5% of total generation in January, with 2.3 TWh, or a year-on-year increase of 19%, it added.",
