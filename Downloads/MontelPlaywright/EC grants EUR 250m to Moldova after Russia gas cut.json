        "body":"Of the total, EUR 100m would be allocated by mid-April, the EC said, adding that it aimed to help Moldovan\u00a0households to\u00a0tackle higher electricity costs until the end of the year.\nIn addition, EUR 50m would be made available to invest in energy efficiency and sustainability\u00a0projects.\nThe EC allocated EUR 60m to tackle the ongoing energy crisis in the separatist region of Transnistrian following the cut in Russian gas supplies through Ukraine last month. This follows a EUR 30m emergency\u00a0grant\u00a0announced by the EC last month to help Transnistria, which also forms part of the two-year scheme.\u00a0\nA total of EUR 15m would also be granted to\u00a0agri-food and manufacturing businesses, the EC added.\u00a0\nPower link\u00a0fundingSeparately, the Moldovan government said late on Monday that the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) would grant the state-owned Moldelectrica EUR 15.4m to build the 400 kV Bal\u021bi-Suceava power interconnector with Romania and to revamp the 400 kV Balti substation.\nThe\u00a0government said\u00a0the project \u2013 with a total cost of EUR 77m \u2013 would enhance energy security\u00a0and increase\u00a0flexibility of the power system, allowing for additional renewables buildout.\nThe Moldovan parliament previously ratified a EUR 30.8m loan agreement with the EBRD, and EUR 30.8m with the European Investment Bank.",
