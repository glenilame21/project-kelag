        "subtitle":"(Montel) Parties at both ends of Germany\u2019s political spectrum pledged sweeping changes to the country\u2019s energy policy at weekend presentations of their election platforms, including a return to Russian gas and removal of wind turbines.",
        "body":"Germany\u2019s right-wing AfD would eliminate all funding programmes or priority access for renewable energy, said Alice Weidel, its candidate for chancellor, at a party conference in Riesa, Saxony at the weekend.\u00a0\n\u201cWe will usher in the end of the energy transition and exit EU climate policy,\u201d said Weidel. \u201cWhen we are at the helm, we will tear down all wind turbines,\u201d she added.\nShe said that the AfD would also eliminate carbon pricing, restart nuclear plants and resume gas purchases from Russia if elected to office after the elections, which are scheduled for 23 February.\nHer party would put the damaged Nord Stream gas pipeline with Russia \u2013 the 2022 sabotage of which remains unsolved \u2013 back into operation, she said.\nShe described carbon pricing as an unnecessary production cost that was putting German industry at a competitive disadvantage.\nGermany\u2019s domestic intelligence services are monitoring the AfD on suspicions of far-right extremism. The party is currently Germany\u2019s second most popular, polling at around 20%.\nNord StreamMeanwhile, the BSW, which was founded last year following a split from Germany\u2019s Left party, has described the sanctions against Russia following its 2022 invasion of Ukraine as a \u201cstimulus programme for the US economy and a killer of German and European companies\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0\nGermany\u2019s federal government should \u201cnegotiate with Russia to obtain cheap natural gas via the remaining string of the Nord Stream pipeline\u201d, the BSW said at a party event in Bonn.\nAs an export-oriented economy, Germany needed cheap energy and supply security, it said. Technologies such as solar and wind alone would not suffice, it added.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nCarbon pricingIn addition, the party said that Europe\u2019s emissions trading scheme was driving the relocation of European industry abroad.\n\u201cWe want to abolish the CO2 price, which makes everything more expensive without there being any alternatives for most people,\u201d the party said.\nThe BSW is polling at just above the 5% threshold required to enter parliament.\u00a0\nCentrist majorityThe centre-right CDU\/CSU, which is currently in opposition, is leading the polls on roughly 30%.\u00a0\nChancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s SPD party is polling at roughly 16% and the Greens at almost 14%. The liberal Free Democrats, whose departure from the coalition collapsed the government late last year, are polling at around 4%.\nCentrist parties have all promised to lower energy costs, with the CDU\/CSU saying that it would close no more power stations until sufficient replacement assets were brought online.",
