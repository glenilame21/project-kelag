        "subtitle":"(Montel) The US is expected to maintain its position as the EU\u2019s third-largest supplier of thermal coal, but US-China tit-for-tat tariffs are unlikely to result in much of a rise in transatlantic volumes, analysts told Montel.",
        "body":"The US exported around 3.1m tonnes of thermal coal to the world\u2019s largest consumer, China, last year, along with 5m tonnes of metallurgical coal, according to Kpler vessel-tracking data.\nHowever, US president Donald Trump this week imposed a 10% tax on Chinese imports, to which China responded with a 15% tax on imports of US coal and LNG.\n\u201cChina will be quick to adapt,\u201d said Toby Hassall, lead coal analyst at LSEG, noting for example that the country had already ramped up imports of coking coal from Mongolia and Russia in recent months.\nUS coal would in turn be redirected to alternative markets, he added.\nHowever, there were also broader macroeconomic implications for the coal market, Hassall said, noting that\u00a0the tariff spat was seemingly a \u201cbearish development\u201d for the global coal market.\n\u201cIt can have a negative impact on China\u2019s economy, which could result in reduced consumption of coal, and therefore, potentially less imports,\u201d he added.\nAlready, the Pacific Basin\u00a0benchmark Ice Newcastle contract today hit USD 111\/t, its lowest since June 2021.\nMore supply to Europe?But the prospect of lower US supply to China was unlikely to result in a significant\u00a0increase in flows across the Atlantic to EU consumers.\nEuropean countries \u2013 excluding Turkey \u2013 imported 3.16m tonnes of US thermal coal last year, or 15% of a total 21.6m tonnes, putting the supplier in third place, after Colombia and South Africa, according to Kpler figures.\n\u201cWe may see an increased volume of US coal flowing to Europe, although prices will ultimately determine where [US exports] end up,\u201d Hassall said.\nAnother coal analyst, with a Swiss trading house, said current price levels would not incentivise any redirection of shipments from the Chinese market to Europe.\n\u201cAt current prices, this 3m tonnes of US coal will rather go domestically [within the US], if not to China,\u201d he said.\nA coal trader with a German utility also noted that the EU-wide ban on Russian coal since\u00a0mid-2022, in response to the war in Ukraine, had reduced the region\u2019s need for US coal.\n\u201cHigh-sulphur coal has kind of lost its spot in Europe, since there is no low-sulphur Russian coal around,\u201d he said.\nUS coal is typically higher in sulphur content than Colombian and South African material, and therefore requires blending with lower-sulphur coal, which until recent years was most commonly sourced\u00a0from Russia.",
