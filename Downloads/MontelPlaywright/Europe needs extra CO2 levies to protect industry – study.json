        "subtitle":"(Montel) Europe may need to introduce an extra levy on carbon-intensive materials on top of other planned mechanisms to ensure the resilience of its industrial sector, a new study by the London School of Economics university said on Wednesday.",
        "body":"The EU\u2019s\u00a0carbon border adjustment mechanism\u00a0(CBAM) in particular may not be sufficient to provide a level playing field if other countries do not pursue comparable carbon pricing strategies,\u00a0said the UK university\u2019s\u00a0report,\u00a0carried out\u00a0in partnership with\u00a0the German Institute for Economic Research\u00a0(DIW).\nAs such, a \u201cstraightforward\u201d charge in the form of a climate contribution would \u201ccomplement, rather than replace\u201d the existing European climate policy framework, particularly the EU and UK emissions trading systems (ETS), free allocation of allowances and carbon contracts for difference.\n\u201cIt would be levied on domestically produced and imported carbon-intensive basic materials like steel, cement and plastic, and be based on standardised values equal to the value of free allowance allocation to conventional production,\u201d the\u00a0report said.\nIt recommended introducing the climate contribution as a \u201cbridging instrument\u201d to complement emissions trading and ensure investment stability and incentives for green industry during the CBAM transition period,\u00a0set to end in December.\u00a0\nThe EU\u2019s CBAM, set to launch in 2026,\u00a0will require companies to buy certificates covering the carbon content of their imported\u00a0products from certain sectors, with the goal of enabling EU producers of similar products to compete more equally with producers from countries with less restrictive carbon constraints.\nThe UK CBAM\u00a0will launch in 2027 without a transition period.\n\u201cAn uncomfortable dilemma\u201dThe\u00a0report\u00a0highlighted limitations of the EU CBAM in its current proposed form, such as a lack of export rebates for carbon costs and limited coverage of the value\u00a0chain.\nAs a result, European policymakers may soon face an \u201cuncomfortable dilemma\u201d,\u00a0it said,\u00a0such as accepting an incomplete carbon leakage protection with the current CBAM design. This would risk loss of competitiveness and production shifting outside the region.\nIt advised the EU to make carbon leakage measures resilient to \u201ca fragmented global climate policy landscape\u201d while modernising and greening industry.\n\u201cIf large carbon price differences persist globally, the EU\u2019s success in leading the industrial transition to carbon neutrality will depend on its ability to navigate these complex trade-offs effectively,\u201d\u00a0the study added.",
