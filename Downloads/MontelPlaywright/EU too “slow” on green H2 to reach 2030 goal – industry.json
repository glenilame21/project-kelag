        "body":"\u201c2030 is not that far away, we are in 2025 and the progress that has been made so far is quite modest,\u201d\u00a0Jose Manuel Perez,\u00a0co-chairman\u00a0of the Renewable Hydrogen Coalition lobby, told a storage and hydrogen conference hosted by Spanish solar association Unef.\nThe bloc would need to install around\u00a080-100 GW of electrolysis capacity to reach its 2030 hydrogen goal, he said.\nHowever, final investment decisions on electrolysers totalled 2 GW of capacity throughout Europe last year, Perez added.\nEuropean countries had been \u201cslower than initially expected\u201d on developing green hydrogen, he\u00a0noted.\nDemand would only reach 2m tonnes by 2030 if the EU achieved\u00a0its target of 42%\u00a0of industrial\u00a0hydrogen\u00a0consumption from\u00a0renewable sources,\u00a0Perez added, in reference to BNEF forecasts.\n\u201cNot a scam\u201dThe hydrogen sector \u201chas lost a little bit of interest\u201d\u00a0amid some \u201cincredulous\u201d participants\u2019 predictions that\u00a0the technology\u00a0would\u00a0fail to\u00a0advance at the speed initially envisaged, Pablo Gomez, CEO of engineering firm Coagener, said at the same event.\nEurope has seen a wave of clean hydrogen project cancellations in recent months.\nHowever, delays in hydrogen deployment did not make developers \u201cfailures\u201d,\u00a0said Brais Armino Franco, a partner at engineering firm atlantHy. \u201cIt does not make us a scam, as many would make the hydrogen sector seem.\u201d\nFinal investment decisions\u00a0in hydrogen projects in Spain could\u00a0reach 1 GW of\u00a0capacity this year, with development\u00a0expected in the next 3-4 years, he added.",
