        "subtitle":"(Montel) German elections on 23 February could decide the extent to which hydrogen is used to decarbonise the country\u2019s economy in the coming decades, attendees at the E-World energy fair in Essen said this week.",
        "body":"\u201cWe are a bit in a void waiting for the new government,\u201d said Sebastian Braun, head of power and hydrogen analytics at commodities consultancy Icis.\nThe outgoing coalition government deemed hydrogen a key plank of its plan\u00a0to become carbon neutral by 2045. \u00a0\nYet a slew of hydrogen project cancellations across Europe last year has thrown into question the viability of many of its suggested applications \u2013 whether as a substitute for fossil fuels in industrial processes or to burn in place of gas in power plants that back up renewable generation.\nIcis has pushed back its projections for hydrogen uptake by around five years. It now only sees European hydrogen demand surpassing 350 TWh in 2031, almost a fifth below its prior expectations. It was until recently forecasting that demand would hit 350 TWh\u00a0next year.\nReality check\u201cWe are starting to come a little to terms with reality,\u201d saidAndreas Fischer, an energy specialist at the German Economic Institute. \u201cEverything is taking longer. But that doesn\u2019t mean the topic of hydrogen is dead or fundamentally the wrong path.\u201d\nChancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s Social Democrats are trailing third in the polls, and are only likely to serve as junior coalition partners following the elections.\u00a0\nFriedrich Merz\u2019s centre right Christian Union (CDU\/CSU) has\u00a0promised to prioritise bringing down energy costs. The CDU\/CSU is\u00a0polling first, but with only around 30% of the vote, meaning it is also likely to\u00a0need partners to form a\u00a0government.\nThe CDU\/CSU is more sceptical of the government\u2019s drive to boost hydrogen, and has emphasised\u00a0carbon capture and storage (CCS) in conjunction with existing fossil fuels as an alternative, especially for backup power generation for renewables.\nHydrogen still crucial\u201cI\u2019m actually not so sure if it\u2019s more cost-efficient to build up a whole CO2 infrastructure all over Germany,\u201d said Philipp Heusser, head of hydrogen at energy consultancy E-bridge.\n\u201cTo account for the political and social [resistance to]\u00a0underground CO2 storage \u2013 in my opinion, that\u2019s the way bigger obstacle to surmount in the future.\u201d\nHydrogen would be essential for German industrial processes with high temperatures that cannot be electrified, he added.\n\u201cWhat we can\u2019t afford are the next years without a clear roadmap, a clear plan, for hydrogen production in Germany,\u201d said Heusser.\nThe low energy density of natural gas and hydrogen meant imports of these would always make their applications less competitive \u2013 irrespective of whether a company opts for CCS or hydrogen to decarbonise, said Alfred Hoffmann, head of energy strategy at German steelmaker Salzgitter.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nImports no substitute\u201cIt is illusory to think we can ever become more competitive on energy costs than the US, China or India,\u201d Hoffmann said.\nHis company is set\u00a0to cut its emissions by 30% from next year as a steelmaking project using hydrogen\u00a0enters large-scale production. Salzgitter hopes to convert its steel mills fully to a process with hydrogen by 2033, cutting emissions by 95%.\nHowever, this will depend on the availability of hydrogen supply and the willingness of customers to pay a premium for green steel, Hoffmann said.\n\u201cOur only chance is to expand generation capacity for power. We need power to produce hydrogen in Germany and Europe. It is the only sustainable way forward, and one that will also happen to make us more competitive again,\u201d he said.",
