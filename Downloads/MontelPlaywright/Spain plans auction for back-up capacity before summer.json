        "subtitle":"(Montel) Spain plans to hold the first auction for new back-up capacity before the summer, aiming to have it operational by January 2026, an energy ministry spokesman said on Wednesday",
        "body":"The so-called capacity market \u2013 on public consultation until 29 January \u2013 was aimed at guaranteeing security of supply, said the ministry.\nIt stipulated that awarded bidders should start providing back-up capacity five years after each tender, yet there would be additional auctions to cover that gap and pay existing plants, he added.\nPlants receiving other capacity payments would be ineligible from the bidding process, the spokesman said, adding units emitting more than 550g CO2\/kWh would also be barred.\nThis mechanism is a response to power sector demands for back-up capacity, including gas-fired units and batteries, which will be needed to cover the intermittency of renewable generation.\nThe government submitted its proposal for the new system to Brussels last year.",
