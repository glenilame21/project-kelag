        "subtitle":"(Montel) Turkey has signed an agreement with Turkmenistan for the supply this year of 1.3bcm of gas, some of which could also be pumped to European markets, Turkish energy minister Alparslan Bayraktar said late on Wednesday.",
        "body":"The supplies would be delivered between March and the end of the year under a swap deal between Turkey\u2019s state-owned pipeline operator Botas and Turkmenistan\u2019s Turkmengaz, Bayraktar said in a statement.\n\u201cIt is\u2026\u00a0important that those resources can go to Turkey and Europe, especially through Turkey, which needs it. In this sense, our infrastructure is ready for this,\u201d he said.\nEU interestSince the halt\u00a0at the start of January of\u00a0Russian gas transit through Ukraine, he noted European countries, notably Slovakia, had expressed interest in sourcing gas from Turkey.\nThe Turkmenistan\u00a0gas will be shipped to Iran and then transported to Turkey\u2019s Gurbulak entry point through the Iran-Turkey gas pipeline.\nTurkey consumes more than 5bcm\/year of gas and relies on supplies from Russia, Azerbaijan and Iran, along with LNG imports from various suppliers.\nIt will\u00a0renegotiate two key gas contracts with Russia at the end of the year,\u00a0potentially expanding its regional transit role following the halting of Russian exports via Ukraine,\u00a0market\u00a0participants told Montel in January.",
