        "subtitle":"(Montel) BP\u2019s natural gas production fell by 3.8% on the year to 4,596m cubic feet\/day (130mcm\/day) in 2024, contributing to a more than 20% decline in the company\u2019s gas and carbon unit earnings, it said on Tuesday.",
        "body":"In turn, BP\u2019s profit from its gas and low carbon segment for the year fell to USD 6.8bn from USD 8.7bn the previous year. It said this reflected in part a lower gas marketing and trading result, lower realised profits and lower production.\n\u201cThe gas marketing and trading result for the quarter was average compared with a strong result in the fourth quarter of 2023,\u201d it said.\nMeanwhile, BP reported 888m bbl\/day of oil equivalent production for the year, down 4.1% from 2023, the UK major said in its full-year results.\nOverall, BP\u2019s underlying replacement cost profit \u2013 which it uses as a proxy for net profit \u2013 dropped by 36% on the year to USD 9bn in 2024, amid weaker realised refining margins, and higher impact from maintenance.\nElsewhere, BP\u2019s renewable energy pipeline at the end of the year amounted to 60.6 GW, up by 2.3 GW from 2023, the company said.\nNew strategyBP CEO Murray Auchincloss said last year the company was \u201creshaping\u201d its portfolio, adding: \u201cWe now plan to fundamentally reset our strategy and drive further improvements in performance.\u201d\nLast October, the company abandoned its goal of reducing oil and gas production by 2030, which led environmental groups to accuse it of prioritising profit over the planet.\nSpeculation has grown over recent weeks that it could be subject to a takeover or merger operation, according to local media reports.\nShares in BP jumped by almost 7% on Monday morning after activist hedge fund Elliott Management purchased a stake in the company, a move that could prompt a shake-up in BP\u2019s strategy, the Financial Times reported.\nBP\u2019s results come after its competitor Shell last month posted an 18% drop in earnings from its gas unit despite reporting higher LNG production volumes.",
