        "subtitle":"(Montel) Serbia has received 40 bids for 1.2 GW of wind and solar capacity \u2013 almost three times the available capacity \u2013 in its second contracts for difference (CFD) renewables auction, the country\u2019s energy ministry said on Friday.",
        "body":"In November, the country invited investors to apply for 300 MW of wind and 124.8 MW of solar capacity. The ceiling was set at EUR 79\/MWh for wind projects and EUR 72\/MWh for solar. The auction closed earlier this week.\n\u201cInterest was very high. We can be sure that we will have strong competition in this round,\u201d said Rade Mrdak, advisor to the energy ministry, in a statement. He added that more bids were made for solar than for wind projects, in a reversal of the trend seen in the previous auction in 2023.\nThe bids will now be evaluated, with the winners likely to be announced in March, Mrdak said.\nSo far, 11 wind farms and 179 solar power plants \u2013 with combined capacity of 608 MW and 182 MW, respectively \u2013 have been connected to Serbia\u2019s transmission grid.\nThe Serbian government\u2019s three-year CFD auction plan unveiled in 2023 aims to allocate market premiums for a total of 1.3 GW of new wind and solar capacity.",
