        "subtitle":"(Montel) The latest tariffs announced by president Donald Trump, on all steel and aluminium entering the US from next month, should spur EU efforts to protect steelmakers and establish regional renewables industry supply chains, industry participants told Montel on Wednesday.",
        "body":"\u201cIt\u2019s a wake-up call,\u201d said Jules Nyssen, head of French renewables lobby SER, with wind turbine towers made of steel, as well as foundations and floating structures. Steel is also used for the structures that support solar panels.\nAlthough the tariffs would not directly concern the supply of steel and aluminium for European equipment manufacturers, Trump\u2019s measures could \u201cpush the European Commission to\u2026start recognising that for certain sectors that are deemed strategic we need to establish local, or at least European, value chains,\u201d he said, citing offshore wind power.\nThere was unlikely to be a \u201cmajor negative impact\u201d on European renewables developers, unless steelmakers \u2013 which partly rely on exports \u2013 were to shut down completely, \u201cwhich I find unlikely\u201d, he said.\nWhile European steelmakers losing access to the US market could potentially result in lower costs for renewables developers amid lower demand, the shutting down of any production capacity could have \u201cquite the opposite effect\u201d, he said.\n\u201cThat would justify protecting the European market,\u201d he added.\nJacques Percebois, head of the Creden energy research centre, agreed that European steelmakers would \u201clikely\u201d be impacted by the new tariffs.\n\u201cBut I\u2019m not sure [Trump] will maintain them in the long term. If Europe\u2019s retaliatory measures significantly affect the US economy, that could make him backtrack,\u201d he added.\nCheap Chinese supply\u201cOur industry is already struggling to compete with cheaper products that could suddenly arrive on the market,\u201d said French industry and energy minister, Marc Ferracci, on French TV \u201cTF1\u201d on Tuesday, adding that Europe needed to \u201cstay united and respond firmly\u201d.\n\u201cThere is currently a lot of Chinese steel entering Europe, and we are fighting at the European level to impose what is called a safeguard clause \u2013 meaning limiting Chinese steel imports to Europe and also imposing a carbon tax at the borders,\u201d he added.\nBut Joseph Fonio, head of RWE Renewables France, played down concerns of any notable impact to the region\u2019s renewables buildout costs.\n\u201cThe impact would be quite marginal because the markets are fairly separate,\u201d he told Montel, noting that while European and Asian supply chains served the European market, the US was largely self-sufficient.\n\u201cThere is very little crossover between European and American supply chains in renewable energy,\u201d he added.\nOn Tuesday, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said that Trump\u2019s tariffs would \u201ctrigger firm and proportionate countermeasures\u201d.\nThis spring, the EC is set to propose a steel and metals action plan, which would include the use of \u201ctrade defence instruments\u201d.",
