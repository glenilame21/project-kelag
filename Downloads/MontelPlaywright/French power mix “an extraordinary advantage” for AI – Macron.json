        "subtitle":"(Montel) France\u2019s abundant supply of low-carbon energy makes the nation an ideal home for data centres to power artificial intelligence, said the president, Emmanuel Macron.",
        "body":"\u201cIn France we have an extraordinary advantage, the electricity we produce is among the least carbon-intensive and the most flexible in the world,\u201d Macron said told French TV on the eve of a two-day artificial intelligence summit in Paris that kicks off on Monday.\n\u201cIn the 1960s our predecessors chose nuclear power, and I have reaffirmed this strategy by relaunching the construction of nuclear reactors,\u201d he said, adding that France had also developed renewable energy and had a \u201csecure and stable\u201d grid.\nThe French president was keen to boost France\u2019s part in the global race to develop AI, promising that the country had enough clean power to spare for data centres.\n\u201cLast year, we exported 90 TWh of electricity, no other European country produces as much decarbonised energy on top of its consumption,\u201d he said.\nNet exports surgeAccording to TSO data, France\u2019s net power exports hit a 22-year high in 2024, thanks to the buoyant supply of nuclear and hydropower, coupled with sluggish demand.\n\u201cWhen you build data centres in France, it\u2019s not the same as in the United States\u2026 too many data centres run on oil or gas,\u201d Macron added.\nFrance would attract EUR 109bn of private investments in artificial intelligence in the coming years from both French and foreign sources, the president said.\nThe government had identified 35 new sites for the construction of data centres, while the United Arab Emirates planned to build a large data centre in France, local reports said last week.\nConsultancy Icis forecast Germany, France and the UK to see the largest data centre power demand in Europe over the next decade, while the Nordics and Ireland could see data centres saturate power demand.",
