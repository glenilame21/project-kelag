        "subtitle":"(Montel) French utility EDF plans to start auctions in 2025 to sell up to 10 TWh per year of\u00a0nuclear power to energy-intensive industry and rival suppliers \u2013 aiming for this to break the negotiation deadlock, sources told Montel.",
        "body":"The state-owned utility\u00a0reached an agreement\u00a0in November 2023 with the government to sell its\u00a0nuclear\u00a0output at an average of EUR 70\/MWh (in 2022 prices) over the period 2026-2040 to replace the Arenh system of EUR 42\/MWh for up to 100 TWh\/year, which expires in 2026.\nHowever, since the presentation of the deal, no long-term\u00a0nuclear\u00a0power supply contracts, called CAPNs, have been signed and\u00a0negotiations are far from\u00a0concluding, said\u00a0lobbyists and others participating in\u00a0the talks.\nOnly six letters of intent have been signed for a volume of 11 TWh\/year, EDF said.\nIndustrialists have urged\u00a0EDF to lower the\u00a0negotiated selling price\u00a0as power prices have dropped but EDF said it needs prices to be high enough to finance its future fleet of at least six nuclear reactors (10 GW).\n\u201cIt\u2019s true that we have letters of intent but no one knows their content and the strike price,\u201d a source said, although industrial sources said\u00a0discussions remained centred\u00a0around EUR 70\/MWh.\n\u201cThe idea with the auctions is to be more transparent for the market on what would be the right price.\u201d\nIf the auctions go ahead, they would\u00a0start in the second half of 2025, he said.\nUncertaintiesEDF\u2019s new plan would not alter the agreement with the government but simply change the commercial strategy, a second source close to the matter said.\nHowever, some aspects of the auction mechanism still need \u201cto be worked on\u201d, the first source said.\nHe said it was not yet clear whether the auctioned 10 TWh per year would be on top or subtracted from the 20-24 TWh per year offered under CAPN contracts.\nAn industrial energy buyer in talks with EDF feared auctions would have \u201ca bullish effect\u201d on the price of long-term nuclear supply contracts.\nA spokeswoman at EDF\u00a0declined to comment but added that its priority remained long-term nuclear supply contracts with industry.",
