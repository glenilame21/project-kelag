        "subtitle":"(Montel) Oil prices were recovering early on Tuesday, after falling around 2% in the previous session, though investor caution was curbing gains amid weak economic data and concerns about potential US tariffs from the new Trump administration.",
        "body":"The front-month contract for Brent crude North Sea oil was last seen up USD 0.40 at USD 77.48\/bbl, while the WTI equivalent was USD 0.37 higher at USD 73.54\/bbl.\n\u201cA risk-off tone across wider markets weighed on sentiment in energy and metal sectors,\u201d said Australia\u2019s ANZ bank a note.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be all eyes on equity markets as the key driver of sentiment and risk assets including crude oil,\u201d Tony Sycamore, market analyst at online trading platform IG, told Montel.\nOil prices would continue to remain under pressure, he added.\nSycamore pointed to DeepSeek, an AI model launched by a Chinese start-up that overtook US-based ChatGPT as the most downloaded free app over the weekend, adding its emergence \u201cthreatens last year\u2019s 25% rally in the Nasdaq 100, driven by AI and tech stocks\u201d.\nMeanwhile, weak economic data out of China, the world\u2019s biggest crude importer, also weighed on sentiment after its purchasing managers index fell to 49.1 in January, said market participants.\nA reading of below 50 shows the economy is contracting.\nTariff risk?\u201cMarkets are also unsettled by the use of tariffs by the US,\u201d said ANZ bank.\nOver the weekend, new US president Donald Trump threatened to impose a 25% tariff on Colombian goods, while also threatening to inhibit the Russian oil trade.\n\u201cWe think the market expects Russia to find some way to mitigate at least some of the impact of these sanctions,\u201d Ajay Parmar, global analytics director at consultancy Icis, told Montel.\n\u201cFurthermore, even if the sanctions did lead to a significant reduction in Russian oil supply, the fact that Opec+ is sitting on over 5m bbl\/day of spare capacity means there is a limit to the upside potential here,\u201d he added.\n\u201cTrump\u2019s recent pressure on Opec to help to lower oil prices only cements this view further for us.\u201d",
