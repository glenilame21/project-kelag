        "body":"Italian foreign minister Antonio\u00a0Tajani\u00a0urged member states last week\u00a0to unify energy markets to combat rising industrial costs and strengthen the bloc\u2019s competitiveness against global rivals.\nHowever, this would face significant technical, infrastructure and political hurdles, according to analysts.\u00a0\n\u201cWe already have a\u00a0single\u00a0energy market in Europe. The issue is we have grid constraints and therefore a single price is hardly conceivable,\u201d said energy lawyer Lorenzo Parola.\n\u201cIn Italy, in fact, we are moving from a system of single national price to a zonal pricing system.\u201d\nFrench resistanceThe proposal would also likely face strong opposition from countries benefiting from lower energy costs, particularly France with its nuclear fleet, experts said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the French will be available to pay a higher price by increasing the export of nuclear power throughout Europe,\u201d Parola said.\nIntegration of Europe\u2019s electricity market would also require \u201csubstantial investments in cross-border infrastructure and regulatory reform that could harm the existing positions of various\u00a0[national]\u00a0operators\u201d, said Alberto Rizzi, a researcher at think tank ECFR Rome.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe focus on market structure as opposed to production capacity was misguided, said Davide Tabarelli, president\u00a0of research firm\u00a0Nomisma Energy\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big mistake to believe it\u2019s enough to have a single market to achieve lower prices,\u201d he said, pointing to three decades of struggling with market models \u201cwithout reaching relevant results\u201d.\nThe competitive advantage of regions like the US, China and India stemmed from greater domestic resource production rather than market design and in Europe this was built in over the decades, he added.\nAlternative solutionsParola\u00a0outlined shorter-term alternatives to a full energy price market integration.\nThese included further development of power purchase agreements (PPAs), continued investment in grid infrastructure and the strengthening of existing government schemes \u2013 such as\u00a0the \u201cenergy release\u201d\u00a0programme in Italy \u2013 to offer discounted prices to energy-intensive industry.\nTabarelli\u00a0called\u00a0for increased domestic production through gas drilling in Italy, Netherlands and the North Sea, alongside renewable energy development and investment in new nuclear capacity.\n\u201cNew market models are useless, more domestic energy production is what we need,\u201d he said.\nWatch the Montel News video report on this topic\u00a0here.",
