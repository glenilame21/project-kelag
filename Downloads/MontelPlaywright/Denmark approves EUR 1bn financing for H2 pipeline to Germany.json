        "subtitle":"(Montel) A majority of parties in the Danish parliament have agreed to provide around EUR 1bn in financing for a new 0.5 GW hydrogen pipeline from Denmark to Germany, the country\u2019s energy and climate ministry said late on Thursday.",
        "body":"They aim was to complete the project by 2030, as the first step in developing an infrastructure for hydrogen that could help with the region\u2019s energy transition, the ministry added in a statement, though a final investment decision was yet to be made.\n\u201cWe need to get the ball rolling on hydrogen, which will require more help. At the moment, market forces can\u2019t do it alone,\u201d energy minister Lars Aagaard said in a statement.\nThe pipeline would ensure Denmark became a large supplier of green hydrogen to industrial customers in Germany, he added.",
