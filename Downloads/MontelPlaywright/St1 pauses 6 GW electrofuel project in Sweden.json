        "subtitle":"(Montel) Finnish energy group St1 has paused plans to produce synthetic fuels for aviation in western Sweden due to a lack of demand, according to local media.",
        "body":"\u201cWe are not continuing the project development at the moment,\u201d Linda Werner, St1\u2019s head of renewable fuel development projects, told daily Dagens Industri.\nShe said the market for aviation electofuels \u2013 hydrocarbons that are artificially synthesised from hydrogen and carbon dioxide \u2013 was developing more slowly than previously anticipated.\nSt1 had developed the project in collaboration with power producer Vattenfall. They planned to develop a plant with an electrolyser capacity of up to 6 GW that could use 25 TWh of electricity a year supplied from offshore wind.\nEarlier in October, Uniper Sweden decided to stop its aviation fuel project (200 MW) in Solleftea for similar reasons.\nIn the past 12 months, several companies in the Nordics have also chosen to stop or delay their various hydrogen projects.",
