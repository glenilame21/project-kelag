        "subtitle":"(Montel) An end to the war in Ukraine could see the return of up to 35bcm of Russian pipeline gas to Europe but the market will otherwise likely remain tight until 2026-27, said Equinor executive Irene Rummelhoff on Wednesday.",
        "body":"\u201cSome kind of settlement [between Ukraine and Russia was] the big unknown\u201d this year in terms of regional supply, she said at an event held by the Norwegian energy major in London, with 35mcm equating to about 7% of the region\u2019s 2024 demand according to figures from the International Energy Agency.\n\u201cBefore the war, there were four big pipeline infrastructure projects that supplied Europe with gas,\u201d she told Montel in an interview on the sidelines of the event, referring to the situation before Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 and when the EU relied on the former for about 40% of its gas demand.\nOf these, the Yamal route via Poland was unlikely to resume operations \u2013 in part due to political opposition from Poland \u2013 and the Nord Stream 1 pipeline was assumed to be permanently damaged following explosions in September 2022, she said.\n\u201cNord Stream 2 still needs a little bit of permitting but we think that will be solved,\u201d she said, noting this route \u2013 via the Baltic Sea to Germany \u2013 could provide 8bcm\/year to Europe.\n\u201cAnd we do expect that Ukraine will then go back to transiting Russian volumes,\u201d she said, noting this could see a further 27bcm of gas from Russia.\nThis would be in addition to ongoing flows, amounting to around 14bcm\/year, via the TurkStream pipeline, through Turkey and Bulgaria, she noted.\nStorage target challengeWithout the flows \u2013 which, of course, are purely hypothetical at present \u2013 Europe was facing a relative tightness in supply this year and possible challenges in meeting existing EU-wide storage targets, of 90% by 1 November, Rummelhoff said.\nEurope could potentially reduce the target to 80-85%, she said.\n\u201cBut going significantly below 80%, I think, is a stretch,\u201d she said, noting a severely cold winter could then lead to supply issues.\n\u201cA blackout situation in any northern European country would be a political disaster,\u201d she added.\nMontel reported on Tuesday that Italy was supporting efforts for a \u201creasonable\u201d lowering of European gas storage filling targets.\nWith the benchmark European TTF Summer contract still at a premium of EUR 4-5 to the Winter contract \u2013 with prices last seen on Ice Endex at EUR 52.81\/MWh and EUR 48.43\/MWh, respectively \u2013 there was little reason for buyers to begin refilling storage facilities, Rummehoff said.\n\u201cWhat [the price spread] tells us is that there is a clear expectation that there will be regulation or regulated storage filling rather than commercial storage filling,\u201d she added.\n\u201cThey\u2019re all anticipating that they\u2019ll get some incentives from the respective governments to fill the storage.\u201d\nHammerfest electrificationMeanwhile, a slim one-seat majority in the Norwegian parliament against electrifying Equinor\u2019s LNG plant at Hammerfest would not affect the company\u2019s plans, the executive said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re really into investing into Hammerfest LNG, it\u2019s extremely important for us and I think also for the Norwegian government, to provide investors with a stable environment,\u201d she said.\n\u201cBacking off an already approved project would be a bit of a surprise, I think,\u201d she said, with the current government supporting the development.",
