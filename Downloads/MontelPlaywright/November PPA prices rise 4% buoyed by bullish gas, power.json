        "subtitle":"(Montel) Prices for European power purchase agreements (PPAs) rose by almost 4% on the month in November tracking bullish gas and power prices, renewables advisory firm Pexapark said on Thursday.",
        "body":"PPA prices in November rose by 3.8% on the month to average EUR 51.1\/MWh, with French and Italian prices recording \u201cnotable\u201d gains of 16% and 11%, respectively, the firm added in its latest monthly report.\nPPA prices rose by 3.4% in the Nordics and by 2.7% in Poland but fell by around 2% in Germany, Pexapark data showed.\nThe overall gains came amid escalations in the Russian-Ukraine war that pushed benchmark commodities prices higher, Pexapark said, noting, for example, that Germany\u2019s Cal 25 baseload power contract touched a one-year high of EUR 103.75\/MWh on 22 November.\nThe Dutch TTF Cal 25 gas contract also peaked at a high for the year of EUR 49.95\/MWh on the same day, exchange data showed.\nIn terms of PPA activity, a total of 1,054 MW of capacity was secured across 18 deals, representing a 10% decrease on the amount of volume secured in October and an almost 15% decrease on the year.\nAll of last month\u2019s deals were concluded by corporates, marking only the second time since May 2022 that no utility had publicly disclosed deals, Pexapark said.\nThe largest November deal was a 10-year contract between Amazon and Irish developer Aer Soleir covering four PPAs linked to a 360 MW onshore wind portfolio in Greece.\nThe deal was the second concluded by Amazon in the country and could elevate the role of onshore wind in the market\u2019s potential, Pexapark said.",
