        "body":"\u201cReducing storage filling obligations decreases quantities and, consequently, tends to lower prices,\u201d said Federico Boschi, head of the energy department at Italy\u2019s environmental and energy ministry,\u00a0late on Monday.\nHe said\u00a0lower demand could help ease market tensions and emphasised\u00a0the importance of \u201cbeing reasonable\u201d in balancing energy security needs with price stability.\nBoschi said\u00a0Germany also believed storage filling constraints should be reviewed, and Italy was open to discussions on lowering them.\nItaly\u2019s gas storage\u00a0was last seen at\u00a0nearly 63% full,\u00a0exceeding the\u00a0EU\u00a0average of\u00a0just under\u00a053%, Gas Infrastructure Europe data\u00a0showed. Compared to the same period in 2024, storage levels are down\u00a01\u00a0percentage point in Italy and 17 percentage points across\u00a0the EU.\nEU\u00a0regulations require storage to be 90% full by November 1, along with intermediate targets.\u00a0However, the legislation is due\u00a0to expire at the end of 2025, unless it is extended.\nEarlier auctionsBoschi\u00a0noted that Italy announced plans a fortnight ago\u00a0to start storage filling\u00a0via auctions\u00a0earlier, perhaps by mid-February rather\u00a0than April as usual.\n\u201cIn a tight gas market, this approach prevents overly concentrated purchasing or transportation orders by spreading them over time,\u201d\u00a0he said.\nBoschi said\u00a0the introduction of incentives for gas storage Italy in 2022 \u2013 and currently under consideration in Germany \u2013 \u201cis something to be assessed in due time\u201d.\nGas price spreadA key priority for Italy\u00a0is eliminating the gas price spread between the Dutch TTF and the Italian PSV as Italian gas consistently trades at a premium over the European benchmark.\nThe PSV-TTF annual average spread reached EUR 2.02\/MWh in 2024, the highest premium since 2019, when it averaged EUR 2.55\/MWh.\u00a0\nHe said Italy\u2019s import costs remained \u201cnearly identical\u201d at import points for northern European gas deliveries whether it received supplies from there or not.\nThese fixed import costs affected its overall gas price despite receiving the country receiving most of its gas supply from southern suppliers like Algeria or Azerbaijan, he said.\nItaly was working on a solution that can be implemented without negotiations with northern European countries, he added, without providing further details.\nUpdates article to correct EU storage percentage change.\nUpdates article to correct reference to 2022 storage incentives introduction.",
