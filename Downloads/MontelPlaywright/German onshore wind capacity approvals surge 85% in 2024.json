        "subtitle":"(Montel) German onshore wind project approvals surged by 85% on the year in 2024, with plans for 2,405 turbines or a record of 14.1 GW of new capacity, lobby group the Wind and Solar Association said on Wednesday.",
        "body":"The average amount of time taken per approval was reduced from 22.4 months \u00a0in 2023 to 17.2 months in 2024, the group said.\nHowever, only 10% of the new approvals were in southern Germany, where construction of wind power capacity has long lagged behind the north.\nSpeeding up the approval and construction of wind turbines was a key objective of the government, which collapsed in November. New elections are set for 23 February. \nApprovals in 2024 far outpaced actual onshore wind installation, which amounted to 2.5 GW from 80 turbines, the group said. Government plans call for onshore wind capacity to grow from 63.2 GW now to 115 GW by 2030.\nHowever, wind turbines have been derided at times by Friedrich Merz, the centre-right CDU candidate widely tipped to be the next chancellor. Meanwhile, the far-right AfD, which is in second place in polling, said this weekend it wants to tear them down.",
