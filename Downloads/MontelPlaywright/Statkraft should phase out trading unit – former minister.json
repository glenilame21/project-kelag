        "subtitle":"(Montel) Norway\u2019s government should order state-owned utility Statkraft to phase out its trading unit,\u00a0former finance minister Trygve Slagsvold Vedum said over the weekend, following reports that key staff had been paid substantial bonuses.",
        "body":"\u201cThe minister of trade and industry should say that the trading activities in Statkraft should be phased out. It is not desirable,\u201d Vedum told news agency NTB.\n\u201cThe main purpose [of Statkraft] must be to produce clean and stable energy for the Norwegian population,\u201d said Vedum, who leads the Centre party that withdrew from the coalition government following a disagreement about energy policies in January. \u201cThe Norwegian state should not be a large power trader and extract large profits from fluctuating electricity prices.\u201d\nDaily newspaper Dagens Naeringsliv reported on Friday that four of Statkraft\u2019s Germany-based traders together earned NOK 226m (EUR 19.3m) in 2023.\nStatkraft told NTB that it had changed its bonus policy from 2023 in response to the high payouts, but also said that\u00a0trading helped reduce price volatility in the markets and had given Statkraft revenues it could\u00a0invest in renewable generation in Norway and elsewhere.\n(EUR 1 = NOK 11.68)",
