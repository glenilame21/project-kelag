        "body":"\u201cWe need to ensure that businesses that invest in decarbonisation make a profit,\u201d Kurt Vandenberghe, the EC\u2019s director-general for climate action, told an event\u00a0organised by French utility Engie\u00a0in Brussels on Monday evening.\nThe EC was starting to focus more on low-carbon \u201cclean\u201d rather than specifically renewable \u201cgreen\u201d energies and look more at the economics of different policy choices, he said.\n\u201cWe will probably be less prescriptive\u201d on how the EU achieves its climate goals, he said, for example by simplifying some of the bloc\u2019s rules. \u00a0\nThe EC would have to be more like policy entrepreneurs, willing to tolerate some risk rather than trying to engineer the perfect solution, he said.\nSupporting industryThe EC\u2019s clean industrial deal strategy planned for\u00a0launch on\u00a026 February would focus on those sectors that know how to decarbonise but do not have an incentive to do so in Europe, said Vandenberghe, without giving more details.\n\u201cWe are working to make such projects bankable,\u201d he said.\nThe EC has previously said it would prioritise support for strategic sectors such as steel, aluminium and clean technologies, and for links to connect large-scale green hydrogen projects to end-users.\nA \u201cbig priority\u201d for the EC,\u00a0he said,\u00a0was working to develop global carbon pricing to ensure a level playing field for European companies competing with global rivals\u00a0facing\u00a0less strict carbon constraints.\nThe EC would also find ways to de-risk private investment in decarbonisation projects and work to ensure a stable regulatory framework \u2013 not tweaking the rules every time situations became difficult, said Vandenberghe.\nThe clean industrial deal strategy will be accompanied by an action plan on affordable energy and proposals for simplifying certain EU regulations. \nThis includes some aspects of the bloc\u2019s carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) for small market players.\u00a0CBAM\u00a0will require companies importing products from certain sectors from 2026 to buy allowances equivalent to their embedded carbon emissions at prices linked to the EU emissions trading system.",
