        "subtitle":"(Montel) Italian power prices could surge 28% to average EUR 140\/MWh in 2025 from EUR 109\/MWh last year, driven by the growth of AI and associated data centres, along with electrification, industrial association Confindustria Brescia told Montel.",
        "body":"\u201cWe\u2019re starting to be concerned [in terms of rising prices],\u201d said the group\u2019s president Franco Gussalli Beretta in an interview this week, adding levels were set to be more than double pre-Covid levels.\nAlong with surging power prices, domestic gas prices were expected to jump 40% to EUR 49\/MWh this year, from an average of EUR 35\/MWh in 2024, nearly triple 2019 levels, he added.\n\u201cThe construction and implementation of data centres, also necessary to manage our factory processes more effectively and essential for the ongoing energy transition, will significantly increase energy demand,\u201d he said.\u00a0\n\u201cThe trajectory we are on is clear but many complex issues remain to be resolved.\u201d\u00a0\nMix of solutionsAddressing the demand surge would requires a mix of solutions, including biofuels, carbon capture and nuclear power, said Gussalli Beretta.\nConfindustria Brescia was assessing various fixes from fuel cell stations to biomethane, prioritising technology-neutral approaches for sustainable decarbonisation.\nLooming Italian rules to help decarbonise industry might seek to boost biomethane uptake as a substitute for natural gas under a scheme that mirrored a policy recently deployed for renewable energy, Montel reported on Monday.\nNorthern Italy\u2019s industrial hub of Brescia, home to a substantial portion of the country\u2019s automotive suppliers and major steel producers, was already grappling with high power prices against the backdrop of weaker exports and a broader manufacturing slowdown, said Gussalli Beretta.\nLevel playing field?Energy costs remained higher than neighbouring nations like Germany and France, which benefit from high levels of cheaper wind and nuclear generation, respectively.\nWith its reliance on gas, Italian industry was not on a level playing field with its EU rivals, with the decoupling of electricity and gas prices to ease production costs for businesses a \u201ckey priority\u201d, added the executive.\nEuropean data centre power demand could surge as high as 287 TWh by 2030, nearly triple current levels, potentially undermining the EU\u2019s green transition by diverting renewable power from other sectors, environmental group Beyond Fossil Fuels said yesterday.",
