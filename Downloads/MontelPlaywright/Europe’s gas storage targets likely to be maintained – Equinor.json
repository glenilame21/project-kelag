        "body":"\u201cWe see that gas prices for the summer are very high, and above the prices for the coming winter, which is not normal,\u201d said Helge Haugane, at the E-World energy fair in Essen, Germany.\nThe Dutch TTF summer contract traded last at EUR 54.71\/MWh, while the winter contract was at EUR 50.70\/MWh.\nThis largely reflected expectations that EU-wide requirements for gas storage facilities to be 90% full by 1 November would be maintained, he added.\nThe EU will struggle to meet this target, amid increased competition with Asia for LNG supplies and existing inventories well below the same period last year, analysts told Montel this week.\nEU-wide gas inventories were seen last at 48.5% of capacity, which was well below the 67% level recorded a year ago.\nAs such, lobby group Eurogas this week urged the European Commission to reassess its gas storage regulation, calling for an overall lowering of the targets.\nTwo-year high pricesThe front-month TTF contract \u2013 a European benchmark \u2013 hit a two-year high of EUR 59.39\/MWh on Tuesday, which Haugane attributed to unusually cold weather, coupled with relatively low LNG imports over the past 12 months and the halt of Russian supplies \u2013 amounting around 15bcm\/year \u2013 through Ukraine from 1 January.\nTo compensate for the lower Russian flows, Europe would need to import around 250 more LNG cargoes this year (equating to some 250 TWh), compared with 2024, he noted.\n\u201cIn an extreme case, you may need up to 350 TWh, which corresponds to around 350 shiploads,\u201d he said, adding there could be competition for these cargoes with Asia.\n\u201cSuddenly the question of how hot it will be in Asia in the summer will affect how much you have to pay in Europe to attract these LNG cargoes,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to return to the extreme price levels we saw a couple of years ago.\u201d",
