        "subtitle":"(Montel) The French government survived a no-confidence vote late on Wednesday, as expected, enabling it to pass a much-disputed 2025 budget, which includes plans for a wholesale tax on state-owned EDF\u2019s nuclear output.",
        "body":"The controversial tax should come into force next year once the current Arenh regulation expires.\nEDF would sell all its nuclear output on the wholesale market with the state taxing the revenues according to thresholds to be set in a separate decree.\nThe budget also includes moves to curb the number of negative and zero-price hours on the market, which surged to a record 544 in France last year.\nHard left La France insoumise (LFI) tabled the no-confidence vote after prime minister Francois Bayrou \u2013 in office for less than two months \u2013 used a constitutional article to force the budget through lower house without a vote on Monday.\nBut the motion failed to win support from the far right and the socialist party with only 128lower house MPs voting in favour, far from the 289 majority required to bring down the government.\nThe budget \u2013 and therefore the EDF tax \u2013 should be enacted by the end of the month after a final vote at the upper house, said government spokeswoman Sophie Primas.",
