        "subtitle":"(Montel) Italy\u2019s landmark power market reform, which has introduced parallel hourly and quarter-hourly trading books in the intraday market, risks fragmenting liquidity, energy industry leaders told Montel.",
        "body":"As part of the market reform\u00a0known as Tide, Italy introduced a dual trading system on the country\u2019s intraday market and its cross-border intraday system on 1 January, creating\u00a0two separate\u00a0products \u2013 one for\u00a0hourly trading and the other for quarter-hourly bids.\u00a0\nThe government\u00a0intends\u00a0Tide\u00a0to align Italy with European market standards by revamping the country\u2019s dispatching and balancing systems and to boost grid flexibility. Power market and grid operator members of\u00a0Europe\u2019s single day-ahead market coupling\u00a0(SDAC) aim to launch 15-minute market time unit products in June.\nComplicating larger tradesPreviously, hourly trading was consolidated in a single market but volumes are now divided between hourly and quarter-hourly segments, traders said.\u00a0This complicated larger trades and raised the risk of price swings, one trader noted.\n\u201cThis division between the two markets creates problems in moments of reduced participation or when there\u2019s high volatility and more uncertainty about how to move within the markets,\u201d said Diego Pellegrino, CEO of domestic energy company Eroga Energia.\u00a0\n\u201cIn this situation, having two markets doesn\u2019t help because one is faced with having to decide in which area to take action.\u201d\nHourly market favoured\u201cFragmentation is unavoidable in the current situation, and indeed the trading desks are noticing some difficulties in trades and reduced volumes,\u201d said Gabriele Franze, Italy country manager at Inxieme Energia. \u201cAs a result, it appears that at least for now the quarterly-hour market is going\u00a0to be\u00a0fairly deserted.\u201d\u00a0\nMost traders \u201care continuing to operate in the hourly market, so it\u2019s a strange situation given that the benefits of combining hourly with quarter-hourly bids aren\u2019t yet materialising\u201d, which is making \u201cthe management of the process not particularly easy,\u201d said Edoardo Volponi, COO of Inxieme Energia.\u00a0\nQuarter-hourly products may help renewable plant owners receive more accurate prices as their output levels can fluctuate greatly within a single hour, a trader said.\nThe current situation may reflect initial teething problems, Franze said, as even Europe\u2019s XBID platform had a slow start during one of its biggest reform overhauls in September 2021 when Greece and Slovakia joined the cross-border intraday trading system.\nMarket participants said traders should\u00a0monitor\u00a0both segments simultaneously to find the best prices and optimise positions.",
