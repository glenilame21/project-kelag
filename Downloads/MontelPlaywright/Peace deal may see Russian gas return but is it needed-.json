        "subtitle":"(Montel) A Ukraine peace deal could conceivably raise the possibility of increased Russian gas flows to Europe and a relaxing of sanctions on its LNG infrastructure, although Europe may no longer need these extra volumes, analysts told Montel.",
        "body":"The comments came after US president Donald Trump began talks this week with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, on ending the war and today announced a trilateral meeting in Munich, with Ukrainian officials.\n\u201cAlthough not officially part of any ceasefire negotiations, there are related talks to resume some Russian gas flows via Ukraine and into the EU,\u201d said Henning Gloystein, director of energy, climate and resources at Eurasia Group.\nBut this would initially likely involve only \u201cmodest volumes\u201d of between 15-40mcm\/day, on a monthly basis and on the provision that a ceasefire held.\nTransit flows via Ukraine amounted to around 40mcm\/day (or 15bcm\/year) prior to their curtailment at start of this year \u2013 as a deal with Moscow expired \u2013 and a similar volume continues to enter southeast Europe via the Turkstream route, through Turkey.\nRelieve pressure\u201cDespite the modest volumes, such an agreement would take significant pressure out of the European gas market,\u201d Gloystein said, with benchmark European TTF front-month prices earlier this week having hit a two-year high of EUR 59.39\/MWh on persisting supply concerns.\nTrevor Sikorski, of Energy Aspects, said transit flows via Ukraine would be the mostly likely route to Europe for any returning Russian gas export flows.\n\u201cPeace feels a long way away but once peace happens, [export via Ukraine] could happen quite quickly,\u201d he said, noting, however, only 10-12bcm would likely return, due to the limited number of remaining contracts between Russian gas monopoly Gazprom and Western buyers.\nBut executive vice president for marketing, midstream and processing at Norwegian energy major Equinor, Irene Rummelhoff, last week told Montel an end to the war could see the return of up to 35bcm of Russian pipeline gas to Europe, via the Ukraine and Nord Stream 2 routes.\nDoes Europe need the gas?\u201cI assume that a resumption of [Russian] gas supplies will happen but not immediately,\u201d said a Greek gas trader, adding it would probably take \u201cseveral months\u201d.\n\u201cVolumes are also likely to be lower because Europe has largely managed to replace the Russian gas,\u201d he said, with the region having diversified its supply since the war began in 2022, when it then relied on Russia for about 40% of its demand.\nYuriy Onyshkiv, a Kyiv-based senior gas analyst at LSEG, was sceptical of any possible resumption of flows via Ukraine, however, even in the case of a peace deal being forged.\n\u201cSo far this was not mentioned and does not seem to be on the table,\u201d he said, adding Ukraine was also not in favour of gas transit resuming.\n\u201cSecondly, the EU commission has repeatedly said Europe does not need Ukraine transit. And thirdly, Trump wants to export more LNG to Europe, so having more Russian gas there does not help him.\u201d\nSanctions removal\u201cThe problem is that everything, as always, depends on what Trump says, which is very volatile,\u201d said Icis analyst Robert Songer, adding an end to the conflict could prove highly beneficial to Russia, should a peace agreement include an end to LNG sanctions.\n\u201cIf sanctions end, Russia gets to commission [6.6m tonnes\/year] Arctic LNG 2 terminal and off we go, coffers get swollen and Russian swagger returns.\u201d\nEnergy Aspects\u2019 Sikorski agreed, noting any removal of sanctions would free up more Russian LNG, \u201cparticularly Arctic LNG, which is ready to produce and hasn\u2019t because of sanctions\u201d.",
