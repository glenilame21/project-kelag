        "body":"Ukrainian\u00a0state-run oil and gas firm Naftogaz said\u00a0it was taking all necessary measures to stabilise the gas supply\u00a0after its production facilities in the\u00a0gas-rich\u00a0Poltava region sustained damage\u00a0earlier today.\nThis had coincided with rising power demand across southeast Europe, due to temperatures dipping well below freezing, Ukrainian energy analyst Vadym Mukha, told Montel.\n\u201cThe situation is quite tough,\u201d\u00a0he\u00a0said, adding that Ukraine had\u00a0begun\u00a0importing 16.7mcm\/day of gas, or\u00a0more than\u00a0a tenth of its winter demand, from Hungary, Slovakia and Poland.\nPower importsSeparately,\u00a0Ukraine was\u00a0importing around 500 MW of electricity during daytime hours from Hungary, Slovakia, Poland and Romania\u00a0today, with that figure\u00a0likely to double over the coming\u00a0days, he added.\nAs such, neighbouring energy markets\u00a0were feeling the squeeze, with\u00a0regional gas prices hitting levels well above the\u00a0European\u00a0benchmark\u00a0front-month\u00a0TTF contract, which traded last on Ice Endex at EUR\u00a059\/MWh.\nBulgarian and Romanian\u00a0front-month gas prices\u00a0were last seen at EUR 66\/MWh and EUR 74.38\/MWh, respectively.\u00a0The latter reached a two-year high on Monday of\u00a0EUR 83.21\/MWh.\nAfter\u00a0retreating\u00a0this morning, the TTF contract rose again to extend its two-year high from yesterday, reaching EUR 59.39\/MWh, its highest point since 3 February 2023.\u00a0\n\u201cPossible spot buying from Moldova, Ukraine or Hungary drives both Bulgarian and Romanian gas prices,\u201d\u00a0said\u00a0a regional gas trader.\nMoldova has been tackling an energy crisis since the start of the year when Russia halted gas deliveries to\u00a0its separatist region Transnistria, a landlocked area\u00a0internationally recognised as part of Moldova but also backed by Russia.\u00a0\nDay-ahead\u00a0power prices in southeast Europe have\u00a0also\u00a0gathered support, with regional benchmark Hungary widening its day-ahead premium to Germany and jumping 13% to EUR 184.36\/MWh\u00a0today.",
