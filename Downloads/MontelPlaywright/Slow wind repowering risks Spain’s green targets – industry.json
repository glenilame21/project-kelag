        "body":"The country would need to add almost 30 GW of wind capacity to meet its target\u00a0of 62 GW\u00a0by 2030,\u00a0with repowering considered key to this. Of this 30 GW,\u00a010-12 GW should come from capacity added to existing plants after repowering, according to government plans.\nHowever,\u00a0long\u00a0permitting\u00a0times were\u00a0hampering\u00a0progress, said Heikki Willstedt, director of energy policy and climate change\u00a0at Spanish lobby\u00a0Wind Energy Association\u00a0(AEE).\n\u201cRepowering could be a good business in Spain but there is no regulatory framework to facilitate it,\u201d\u00a0he added.\nSpain\u00a0was\u00a0among the countries that\u00a0failed\u00a0to\u00a0enact\u00a0an EU directive to streamline\u00a0permitting\u00a0for repowering renewable plants,\u00a0potentially limiting\u00a0administrative deadlines to 12 months, Willstedt said.\u00a0\nSpain has until May to\u00a0apply\u00a0this EU legislation,\u00a0which would\u00a0reduce\u00a0permitting times\u00a0\u201cfrom four years to just one\u201d, said\u00a0Javier Pamos, product manager at Aurora Energy Research in Spain.\nIts neighbour Portugal had already simplified\u00a0permitting\u00a0for repowering plants, he said, which had \u201csignificantly\u201d\u00a0sped\u00a0up\u00a0the process.\n\u201cNumbers don\u2019t add up\u201dAs well as\u00a0administrative hurdles, the pace of repowering in Spain\u00a0has been\u00a0slow\u00a0as\u00a0the\u00a0\u201cnumbers don\u2019t add up from an economic standpoint\u201d, said Marta Fernandez Bordon, business development director\u00a0at Spanish\u00a0utility\u00a0Acciona.\nThe wind sector would need specific auctions for repowering or long-term\u00a0support\u00a0to cover part of the costs, she added.\nThe Spanish government\u00a0in 2023\u00a0announced EUR\u00a0148m\u00a0in aid for wind repowering, but this will only allow 557 MW of capacity.\u00a0\nThe business case\u00a0for repowering\u00a0wind assets was\u00a0also hampered by\u00a0high\u00a0interest rates,\u00a0increased\u00a0operating costs and logistical\u00a0hurdles, said Willstedt.",
