        "body":"\u201cIf the Biden administration is looking for a compelling case against [LNG exports], they probably didn\u2019t get it,\u201d said Jason Feer, global head of business intelligence at consultancy Poten & Partners.\nThis was in response to a long-awaited US energy department report, published on Tuesday, on the economic, environmental and social effects of LNG exports from the US.\nThe Biden administration in January paused authorisation of new LNG export decisions as it awaited the results of the report.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve tried to spin it the best they can,\u201d Feer said, referencing a statement from energy secretary Jennifer\u00a0Granholm that \u201cunfettered exports of LNG would increase wholesale domestic natural gas prices by over 30%\u201d.\nIn its most extreme scenario, the report said a 239.4m tonnes\/year increase in US LNG exports by 2050 would lead to a 31% jump in Henry Hub gas prices by 2050, to USD 4.62\/MMbtu.\nBut other scenarios projected domestic gas price increases of between just 3-7%.\n\u201cThis kind of supports the notion that additional exports aren\u2019t going to cost Americans a tremendous amount of money,\u201d Feer said.\nThe report also said cumulative carbon dioxide equivalent emissions could increase by between 21m tonnes and 1,452m tonnes, which Feer said was not \u201cterribly meaningful\u201d.\n\u201cPoke holes\u201dThe study \u2013 which is now subject to a 60-day public comment period \u2013 had not caused Wood Mackenzie to change its view on US projects making final investment decisions, said Mark Bononi, analyst with the consultancy.\nAnd this consultancy period would leave room for opponents \u201cto poke holes in the administrative\u00a0record\u201d, said Thomas Sharp, of consultancy Arbo.\nIf the opposition could \u201csow enough doubt with respect to the veracity of the study\u201d during this period, justification for rescinding it and using previous studies to resume issuing export authorisations would be strengthened, he noted.\u00a0\nNew Trump study?The incoming Trump administration in January could also commission a new study, he added.\n\u201cIn all likelihood, the report will be withdrawn by the next administration to remove any patina of authoritativeness it might have,\u201d said Scott Segal, partner with energy law firm Bracewell.\n\u201cThere are ample grounds for withdrawal of the report,\u201d he said, pointing to US budget office guidelines designed to ensure the quality, objectivity, utility and integrity of information disseminated by federal agencies.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cIn light of its biases, it is arguable that the report does not meet the standards contemplated,\u201d he said.\n\u201cEnvironmentalists who think they\u2019re going to use this in a legal fight are misguided,\u201d echoed Frank Maisano, senior principal at Bracewell.",
