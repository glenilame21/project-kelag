        "body":"The terminal stopped production on 28 January, with the outage being delayed several\u00a0times and the previous restart due today.\u00a0The cause of the outage has yet to be determined.\nThe terminal\u2019s operator, Gastrade, has yet to confirm the restart date.\nThe Alexandroupolis terminal began operations in October and is considered key for the region\u2019s efforts to diversify away from Russian gas imports.\nA regional gas trader told Montel that southeast Europe (SEE) gas markets were \u201cextremely bullish\u201d at the moment due to a cold spell \u2013 rather than to the ongoing outage.\nThe spot gas price on Bulgaria\u2019s gas exchange Balkan Gas Hub settled at EUR 65.56\/MWh for Monday, while the Romanian equivalent on the BRM exchange stood at EUR 72.49\/MWh. Both prices have gained over 30% compared to Friday.",
