        "subtitle":"(Montel) The final investment cost of EDF\u2019s new European pressurised reactor at Flamanville will reach EUR 23.7bn (in 2023 euros), EUR 1.1bn above the utility\u2019s most recent estimate, according to a French auditors\u2019 report on Tuesday.",
        "body":"In November 2023, the French utility forecast the reactor would cost EUR 22.6bn.\nThat estimate did not include the cost of EDF\u2019s plan to shut down the reactor for a year from 2026 to repair a faulty lid or financial provisions for the dismantling of the reactor and the management of nuclear waste, the auditors said.\n\u201cUnprofitable\u201dThe 1.6 GW Flamanville 3 EPR, France\u2019s first new reactor in more than 20 years, was finally connected to the grid in December, 12 years behind schedule and billions over budget, but has yet to enter commercial service.\nGiven investment costs and the price of atomic output, Flamanville would \u201cnot be profitable\u201d, a court auditor told a press conference to launch the report.\nThe company aimed to sell atomic output at EUR 70\/MWh on average from 2026 under a deal with the government.\nUnder the current Arenh regulation, EDF sells 100 TWh annually of its atomic output, just under a third of its total, to rival suppliers at a fixed rate of EUR 42\/MWh. In 2024, French day-ahead power prices averaged EUR 59\/MWh on the wholesale market.\nMeanwhile, the report also said EDF\u2019s plan to build six new reactors in France by 2050 will likely cost more than EUR 100bn, urging it to wait until it secures financing.",
