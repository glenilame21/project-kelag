        "subtitle":"(Montel) The European Commission has launched an investigation into Poland's EUR 45bn plan to subsidise the building of 3.8 GW of nuclear capacity, doubting it is \u201cfully in line with EU state-aid rules\u201d, it said on Wednesday.",
        "body":"There were question marks over the country\u2019s plan to offer a 60-year subsidy, it added, with Brussels cutting the length of similar aid for the 1.2 GW Czech Dukovany reactor from 60 to 40 years.\nThe commission would examine whether there could have been other companies than PEJ interested in leading the project, which might have resulted in a smaller amount of aid offered, the EC\u2019s press officer for competition Nina Ferreira told Montel.\nPEJ is a state-owned nuclear developer and was assigned the job without a tender by the government.\nPoland is expecting the new capacity to come online by 2038 at the latest to help fill a generation gap amid planned coal plant closures.",
