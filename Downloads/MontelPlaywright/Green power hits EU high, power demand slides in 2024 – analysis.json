        "body":"\u201c2024 has seen the share of renewable generation across Europe reach all-time highs as the share of generation from fossil fuels declined,\u201d added the analyst firm in its new European Electricity Market Summary report.\nThe average share of renewables, including waste, in the power mix rose to a record 50.4%, an increase of 2.9 percentage points year on year, while fossil fuels share dropped 4.5 points to 24.9%, the data showed.\nThe share of nuclear power, on the other hand, climbed 1.7 percentage points to 24.7% in 2024.\n\u201cThis trend was driven by the French nuclear recovery, as well as declining fossil fuel generation and demand,\u201d the analysts said, with less outages suffered by France\u2019s ageing reactor fleet.\nNo demand recoveryOverall power demand in the region, meanwhile, slid 7.7% to 2,678 TWh, according to Montel Analytics data, with the continent seeing no recovery in demand in the wake of the European energy crisis.\nEuropean energy prices reached record levels in summer 2022, following the start of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, with the EU urging consumers to cut demand amid supply fears with the consequent curtailment of Russian gas flows.\nHigh energy costs remained among the main issues for German industrials, which make up more than 40% of the total power consumption in Europe\u2019s biggest economy, said the report.\nPrivate solar installations also put downward pressure on demand, with an increasing number of households consuming their own power, it added.",
