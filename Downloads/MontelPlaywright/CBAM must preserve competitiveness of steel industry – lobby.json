        "subtitle":"(Montel) Proposals to simplify the EU carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) must go hand in hand with a \u201cwatertight\u201d design to preserve the competitiveness of the steel industry, the European steel association Eurofer said on Thursday.",
        "body":"Improvements were \u201curgently needed\u201d to pave the way for steel decarbonisation in the bloc, with a focus on addressing issues such as resource shuffling, exports and the inclusion of downstream products, added the Brussels-based lobby group.\nIts statement follows European Commission deliberations last week regarding the\u00a0simplifying\u00a0of the mechanism for 80% of eligible companies and on the back of a high-level conference on the instrument held in Paris yesterday.\nToo late?\u201cAlarmingly, during the conference, the commission announced that legislative proposals on crucial aspects of the [CBAM], including exports provisions and coverage of downstream sectors, will only be presented at the beginning of next year,\u201d the lobby group said.\n\u201cFurthermore, a top priority for securing steel decarbonisation investments in Europe \u2013 which is tackling resource shuffling \u2013 is currently not [even] listed in the commission\u2019s planning of upcoming legislative proposals,\u201d Eurofer added.\nResource shuffling refers to incidents where a producer in a non-EU country would export less carbon-intensive goods to the EU, while keeping more carbon-intensive products for domestic markets, potentially avoiding CBAM charges.\nEurofer said it was concerned about the \u201cdiffering timelines\u201d allocated to the simplification and effectiveness of CBAM.\nDeep concerns\u201cWhile the commission is fast-tracking simplification\u2026 the European steel industry remains deeply worried about the lack of urgency in ensuring CBAM\u2019s effectiveness,\u201d it said.\nThe group recommended introducing a legislative solution prevent resource shuffling, adding there should be a \u201cstructural solution\u201d to preserve European exports, as well as extending CBAM\u2019s scope to steel-intensive downstream products.\nLaunching the mechanism without the necessary improvements would \u201cfurther erode\u201d the competitiveness of the European steel industry, it added.\n\u201cThis is indispensable given that the EU carbon price has reached approximately [EUR] 80\/t, while over 25m tonnes of steel \u2013 equivalent to around 20% of EU production \u2013 are imported annually from third countries without any carbon cost.\u201d\nThe benchmark Dec 25 EUA contract was last seen trading down EUR 2.09 at EUR 78.20\/t.",
