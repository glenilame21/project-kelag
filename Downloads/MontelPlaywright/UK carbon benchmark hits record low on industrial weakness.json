        "subtitle":"(Montel) The UK\u2019s benchmark carbon contract plunged on Monday to its lowest ever price since the creation of the country\u2019s emissions trading scheme in 2021 amid weak industrial indicators, before making a slight recovery in afternoon trading.",
        "body":"The Dec 25 UKA was last seen trading at GBP 33.60\/t,\u00a0up GBP 2.06\u00a0on Friday\u2019s settlement.\nEarlier today, however, the contract hit GBP 31.10\/t, a fresh record low price for the front-December UKA contract on a rolling basis, according to Ice exchange data.\n\u201cDespite a cold spell that boosted gas power generation and resulted in a bullish first auction of the year, UKAs entered the year on a bearish note,\u201d said consultancy ClearBlue Markets in a note.\nThe first UK emissions\u00a0auction\u00a0of the year \u2013 held on 8 January \u2013 saw more than 2.2m allowances\u00a0successfully cleared\u00a0at GBP 32.80\/t, Ice data showed.\nThe previous record low trade for the front-December\u00a0UKA contract was GBP 31.10\/t on 29 January 2024.\n\u201cNegative\u00a0industrial indicators\u201d\u201cThis\u00a0bearish trend in the UK carbon market was likely driven by negative industrial indicators, reduced fund positions and a lack of regulatory signals,\u201d\u00a0ClearBlue Markets\u00a0added.\nLast week, the UK\u2019s Office for National Statistics (ONS) released the\u00a0index of production\u00a0for November 2024, which revealed that industrial output in the country fell by 0.4% in that\u00a0month.\nThis was the third consecutive monthly fall in production output, ONS data showed.\nSpeculative investors\u2019 net long position in UKAs reached 7.9m tonnes as of 10 January, having previously been net short by 1.5m tonnes the week before.\nClearBlue Markets also\u00a0pointed to a lack of clarity surrounding a supply adjustment mechanism\u00a0(SAM).\nA SAM is a type of market stability policy that automatically\u00a0amends the\u00a0supply\u00a0of allowances in the market in response to certain pre-determined criteria and market conditions.\nThe UK ETS has operated without a SAM since its launch in 2021. The government\u2019s UK ETS Authority began a consultation on introducing the SAM in December 2023, but it remains unclear when this\u00a0mechanism\u00a0will be introduced.\nInvestment fund positions would likely decrease if SAM introduction delays occurred, the consultancy said.",
