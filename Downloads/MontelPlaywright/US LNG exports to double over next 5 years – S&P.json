        "body":"This came on the back of plans by US president-elect Donald Trump to ramp up production, which could provide a USD 1.3 trillion boost to the domestic economy, added S&P in a new report, according to the UK business daily.\nAfter a pause amid environmental concerns instituted by the Biden administration, the oil and gas industry is poised to get approval to build new export facilities and pipelines in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\u201cContracts in place\u201d\u201cWe already have large contracts in place with major LNG suppliers and we certainly expect to get more of that,\u201d said Alan Armstrong, chief executive of Williams, one of the largest gas pipeline companies in the US.\nThe US LNG export market has been a key for European supply since the curtailment of Russian gas flows amid the fallout from the Ukraine war and Trump has vowed to roll back regulations, appointing former North Dakota governor Doug Burgum as secretary of the interior, tasked with slashing red tape.\u00a0\nGiven this approach, Anatol Feygin, COO of US energy major Cheniere, told the FT the country would remain the world\u2019s biggest exporter of the chilled fuel for decades to come.",
