        "body":"During such a \u201cdunkelflaute\u201d event for an hour on 12 December, for example, the Polish power price was EUR 165\/MWh, compared with EUR 936\/MWh in neighbouring Germany, it said on Tuesday in an opinion on Poland\u2019s national assessment of its generation resource adequacy.\nThis assessment looks at whether Poland has enough power resources to ensure its supply security, and if extra measures, such as capacity mechanisms, are justified.\nAcer said the assessment underestimated the power import capacity available and did not consider exports. This meant it did not consider the full benefits of cross-border trading, \u201cwhich help reduce overall system costs and improve adequacy\u201d.\n\u201cAllocation constraints\u201dThe Polish power TSO applied \u201callocation constraints\u201d which sometimes limit exports from Poland, even when neighbouring market prices are much higher, said Acer.\nThis meant Poland\u2019s power prices did \u201cnot reflect regional shortages effectively, limiting earnings for local generators and demand response providers\u201d.\nPoland\u2019s assessment also did not fully consider the impact of demand-side response and battery storage, said Acer.\nRemoving barriers to developing these would help \u201calleviate concerns that might otherwise justify extending the existing capacity mechanism\u201d.\nAcer recommended that the Polish climate ministry and TSO take its opinion into account and if needed update the assessment to provide \u201ca more accurate picture of the country\u2019s electricity adequacy\u201d.\nThe Polish national resource adequacy assessment complements the European analysis carried out each year by formal EU power TSO body Entso-E and reviewed by Acer.\nEU rules require Acer to review any national assessments and comment on differences with the European resource adequacy assessment.",
