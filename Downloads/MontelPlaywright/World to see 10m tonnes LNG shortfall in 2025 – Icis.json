        "subtitle":"(Montel) Global LNG demand growth, especially in Europe, will outstrip supply in 2025, leading to a 10m tonnes shortfall, according to consultancy Icis.",
        "body":"The world\u2019s thirst for LNG will rise 4% to 435m tonnes this year, driven mainly by a 13% surge in European demand, while production will also increase 4% to 425m tonnes, Icis said in an analyst note published on Monday.\nLNG has become a lifeline to European gas markets as it replaces Russian sources since the invasion on Ukraine in 2022.\nThe liquid fuel supplies most of the region\u2019s gas, followed by Norwegian piped flows, and its share is set to continue increasing as Europe loses more of its Russian supplies.\nEuropean surgeEuropean LNG demand, excluding Turkey, will reach 110m tonnes, according to Icis forecasts.\n\u201cTo restore market balance, [TTF gas prices] may rise, particularly in Q1 2025, to curb LNG consumption in price-sensitive markets,\u201d it said.\nMeanwhile, major Asian buyers \u2014 China, Japan, India, and South Korea combined \u2014 should see a 1% year on year decline in LNG demand in 2025.\nHowever, China\u2019s consumption alone will increase to 83.7m tonnes, thanks to rising industrial and commercial demand, along with increasing domestic gas production.\nJapan would see the biggest decrease, followed by South Korea, although India\u2019s will surge.\nGlobal output, meanwhile, will rise in 2025 with the recently added capacity of LNG projects in the US and planned projects in Canada, as well as Senegal and Mauritania.",
