        "body":"Regional conflicts and geopolitical strains are highlighting significant fragilities in today\u2019s global energy system, making clear the need for stronger policies and greater investments to accelerate and expand the transition to cleaner and more secure technologies, according to the IEA\u2019s new\u00a0World Energy Outlook\u00a02024. The latest edition of the\u00a0World Energy Outlook (WEO),\u00a0the most authoritative global source of energy analysis and projections, examines how shifting market trends, evolving geopolitical uncertainties, emerging technologies, advancing clean energy transitions and growing climate change impacts are all changing what it means to have secure energy systems. In particular, the new report underscores that today\u2019s geopolitical tensions and fragmentation are creating major risks both for energy security and for global action on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.The report\u2019s projections based on today\u2019s policy settings indicate that the world is set to enter a new energy market context in the coming years, marked by continued geopolitical hazards but also by relatively abundant supply of multiple fuels and technologies. This includes an overhang of oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG) supply coming into view during the second half of the 2020s, alongside a large surfeit of manufacturing capacity for some key clean energy technologies, notably solar PV and batteries.\u201cIn the second half of this decade, the prospect of more ample \u2013 or even surplus \u2013 supplies of oil and natural gas, depending on how geopolitical tensions evolve, would move us into a very different energy world from the one we have experienced in recent years during the global energy crisis,\u201d said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol. \u201cIt implies downward pressure on prices, providing some relief for consumers that have been hit hard by price spikes. The breathing space from fuel price pressures can provide policymakers with room to focus on stepping up investments in clean energy transitions and removing inefficient fossil fuel subsidies. This means government policies and consumer choices will have huge consequences for the future of the energy sector and for tackling climate change.\u201dBased on today\u2019s policy settings, the report finds that low-emissions sources are set to generate more than half of the world\u2019s electricity before 2030 \u2013 and demand for all three fossil fuels \u2013 coal, oil and gas \u2013 is still projected to peak by the end of the decade. Clean energy is entering the energy system at an unprecedented rate, but deployment is far from uniform across technologies and markets.In this context, the WEO-2024 also shows that the contours of a new, more electrified energy system are coming into focus as global electricity demand soars. Electricity use has grown at twice the pace of overall energy demand over the last decade, with two-thirds of the global increase in electricity demand over the last ten years coming from China. \u201cIn previous World Energy Outlooks, the IEA made it clear that the future of the global energy system is electric \u2013 and now it is visible to everyone,\u201d said Dr Birol. \u201cIn energy history, we\u2019ve witnessed the Age of Coal and the Age of Oil \u2013 and we\u2019re now moving at speed into the Age of Electricity, which will define the global energy system going forward and increasingly be based on clean sources of electricity.\u201d \u201cAs with many other global energy trends today, China is a major part of what is happening,\u201d Dr Birol added. \u201cWhether it\u2019s investment, fossil fuel demand, electricity consumption, deployment of renewables, the market for EVs, or clean technology manufacturing, we are now in a world where almost every energy story is essentially a China story. Just one example: China\u2019s solar expansion is now proceeding at such a rate that, by the early 2030s \u2013 less than ten years from now \u2013 China\u2019s solar power generation alone could exceed the total electricity demand of the United States today.\u201dGlobal electricity demand growth is set to accelerate further in the years ahead, adding the equivalent of Japanese demand to global electricity use each year in a scenario based on today\u2019s policy settings \u2013 and rising even more quickly in scenarios that meet national and global goals for achieving net zero emissions.For clean energy to continue growing at pace, much greater investment in new energy systems, especially in electricity grids and energy storage, are necessary. Today, for every dollar spent on renewable power, 60 cents are spent on grids and storage, highlighting how essential supporting infrastructure is not keeping pace with clean energy transitions. Secure decarbonisation of the electricity sector requires investment in grids and storage to increase even more quickly than clean generation, and the investment ratio to rebalance to 1:1. Many power systems are currently vulnerable to an increase in extreme weather events, putting a premium on efforts to bolster their resilience and digital security. \u00a0Despite growing momentum behind clean energy transitions, the world is still a long way from a trajectory aligned with its net zero goals. Decisions by governments, investors and consumers too often entrench the flaws in today\u2019s energy system, rather than pushing it towards a cleaner and safer path, the report finds. Reflecting the uncertainties in the current energy world, the WEO-2024 includes sensitivity analysis for the speed at which renewables and electric mobility might grow, how fast demand for LNG might rise, and how heatwaves, efficiency policies and the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) might affect electricity demand going forward.Based on today\u2019s policy settings, global carbon dioxide emissions are set to peak imminently, but the absence of a sharp decline after that means the world is on course for a rise of 2.4\u00a0\u00b0C in global average temperatures by the end of the century, well above the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 \u00b0C. The report underlines the inextricable links between risks of energy security and climate change. In many areas of the world, extreme weather events, intensified by decades of high emissions, are already posing profound challenges for the secure and reliable operation of energy systems, including increasingly severe heatwaves, droughts, floods and storms.A new energy system needs to be built to last, the WEO-2024 emphasises, one that prioritises security, resilience and flexibility, and ensures that benefits of the new energy economy are shared and inclusive. In some regions of the world, high financing costs and project risks are limiting the spread of cost-competitive clean energy technologies to where they are needed most. This is especially the case in developing economies where these technologies can deliver the biggest returns for sustainable development and emissions reductions. Lack of access to energy remains the most fundamental inequity in today\u2019s energy system, with 750 million people \u2013 predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 without access to electricity and over 2 billion without clean cooking fuels.To address the evolving energy challenges faced by countries around the world, the IEA is convening an International\u00a0Summit on the Future of Energy Security in the second quarter of 2025. Hosted by the UK government in London, the Summit will assess the existing and emerging risks facing the global energy system, focusing on solutions and opportunities. And to explore the implications of AI for the energy sector, the IEA will host a Global Conference on Energy & AI at its headquarters in Paris on 4 and 5 December. High-level participants will discuss how pioneering AI technologies can change the way the world produces, consumes and distributes energy.",
