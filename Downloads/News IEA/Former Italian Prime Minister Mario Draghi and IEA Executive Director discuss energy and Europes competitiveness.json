        "body":"The IEA hosted former Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi at its headquarters in Paris today for an open discussion with Ambassadors, business leaders and other key figures on Europe\u2019s energy challenges and the implications for its competitiveness.The conversation between Professor Draghi and IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol, who both shared their views and took questions from participants, explored how Europe can bring down its high energy costs and use its decarbonisation ambitions to support stronger economic growth. It followed the publication last month of Professor Draghi\u2019s highly anticipated report on EU competitiveness, which European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen requested to inform the bloc\u2019s future strategy.During the discussion today, which was led by Ambassador of France Am\u00e9lie de Montchalin, Professor Draghi noted that the IEA\u2019s guidance was crucial to the report\u2019s development and often cited IEA analysis. He spoke about how Europe can reduce its reliance on imported fossil fuels with volatile prices.Highlighting the influence of the European Union\u2019s single market, Professor Draghi noted that the region\u2019s transition to clean energy could boost Europe\u2019s energy security and economic growth potential with strong policies to address remaining roadblocks, such as the need to ensure the secure integration of renewables into electricity grids and to diversify clean energy supply chains.",
