        "body":"The IEA today released a new, AI agent for users to explore the 2024 edition of the Agency\u2019s flagship\u00a0World Energy Outlook \u2013 allowing anyone curious about the report\u2019s findings to more easily dig into its data, analysis and projections.The GPT tool, built on Microsoft Azure using Copilot Studio, was first announced at the IEA\u2019s Global Conference on Energy & AI held in Paris earlier this month.The agent \u2013 powered by an AI model that has been trained on the full World Energy Outlook 2024 (WEO-2024) report \u2013 can answer questions about energy trends using natural, conversational language. For example, a user can ask, \u201cWhat are the expectations for growth in global electricity demand over the next decade?\u201d and quickly receive an answer based on the report\u2019s analysis. The first-of-its-kind tool is being launched as \u00a0a beta version today. The IEA will continue to test and develop the agent over the coming months as it interacts with website users. It is part of the IEA\u2019s wider efforts to make its data and statistics more freely available, including through a growing library of data explorers.You can try the GPT tool here. The page includes key tips for getting the most out of the AI agent. For instance, clarifying IEA scenarios, regions and timeframes helps to produce the most accurate and relevant responses. The tool is also available directly on the WEO-2024 report page.Since AI-generated content may contain errors or inaccuracies, users seeking detailed or official interpretations of WEO-2024 data and analysis should refer to the full report or contact the IEA.",
