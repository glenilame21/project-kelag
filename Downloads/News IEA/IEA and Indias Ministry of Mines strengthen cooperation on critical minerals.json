        "body":"The IEA and the Government of India\u2019s Ministry of Mines have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) which lays out a co-operation framework on critical minerals, the essential materials that go into today\u2019s clean energy technologies.The MoU, which defines areas of co-operation ranging from critical minerals data and statistics to the sharing of best practices for modelling and analysis, was exchanged today in the presence of India\u2019s Minister for Coal and Mines Kishan Reddy. It was signed by IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol and Secretary of the Ministry of Mines Shri\u00a0V.L.\u00a0Kantha\u00a0Rao at a workshop on critical minerals recycling organised by the IEA and the Ministry of Mines.The supply and security of critical minerals remains an important topic for policy makers around the world due to increasing demand, volatile price movements, supply chain bottlenecks and geopolitical uncertainties. The IEA is placing a strong focus on critical minerals analysis, with the Agency set to release a World Energy Outlook special report in November. It addresses the role of critical minerals recycling and business models emerging in areas such as urban mining, the practice of extracting valuable resources from electronic waste and discarded appliances. The latest report follows the IEA\u2019s Global Critical Minerals Outlook report published earlier this year.",
