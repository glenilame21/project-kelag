        "body":"The new\u00a0Global Commission on People-Centred Clean Energy Transitions: Designing for Fairness\u00a0recently convened by the IEA held its first meeting in Foz do Igua\u00e7u, Brazil, on Friday during the gathering of G20 energy ministers. Members, along with other ministers who joined the meeting, discussed key considerations for fully integrating the principles of fairness and affordability into the design of all clean energy policies, laying a strong foundation for the Commission to advance its work in the months ahead.\u00a0The Commission, which is co-chaired by\u00a0Alexandre Silveira de Oliveira, Brazil\u2019s Minister of Mines and Energy, and\u00a0Teresa Ribera, Spain\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for the Ecological Transition and Demographic Challenge, comprises energy, climate and labour leaders from governments around the world, along with high-level representatives from international organisations and labour, Indigenous, youth and civil society groups. It is focused on developing actionable recommendations for international decision makers so they can enact effective clean energy policies that are also equitable, inclusive and deliver widespread socio-economic benefits.On Friday, members discussed the findings of a\u00a0new paper\u00a0released just ahead of the meeting. The Commission\u2019s first output, it outlines seven major questions around affordability and fairness in clean energy transitions \u2013 for example, how policies can ensure low-income and marginalised communities can afford clean energy technologies, how decent jobs for workers can be realised as transitions accelerate, and how to deliver the meaningful participation of all stakeholders in the transition process. It also presents a selection of best practices from around the world to address these matters.\u201cUnprecedented momentum is building behind the world\u2019s shift to clean energy. But to keep up the pace of progress, the benefits need to be felt by all,\u201d said\u00a0IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol, who delivered the opening remarks. \u201cThis Global Commission recognises that equity and fairness must be at the heart of our energy strategies and policies, and today\u2019s discussions reflected a wide range of valuable experiences and perspectives. I\u2019m grateful to Deputy Prime Minister Ribera and Minister Silveira for their leadership \u2013 and to the Commission members for their important contributions. We look forward to advancing this work, which will empower international decision makers to drive meaningful change as transitions accelerate.\u201d\u00a0\u201cToday, at the first meeting of the Global Commission, alongside the G20 discussions, we reaffirmed that addressing the social dimensions of clean energy transitions is not just an option \u2013 it is a necessity,\u201d said\u00a0Minister Silveira. \u201cBrazil looks forward to working with Commission members over the next months to ensure that fairness, affordability and inclusivity drive our transition strategies, ensuring that all communities, especially the most vulnerable ones, share in the benefits of transitions.\"\u00a0\u201cImproving the ability to combine decarbonisation with solutions that improve people's lives is one of the most important elements to dedicate ourselves to as decision makers. We can be inspired to scale measures that have worked,\u201d said\u00a0Deputy Prime Minister Ribera. \u201cI encourage you all to address energy transition challenges while responding to the legitimate expectations of welfare of workers and local communities.\u201dOver the coming months, Commission members will collaborate on an implementation roadmap, which will outline available policy tools and options for policy makers and international stakeholders to address the seven key questions. During this phase, members will also explore metrics to assess the effectiveness of implemented strategies and policies.",
