        "subtitle":"Representatives from heat pump manufacturers, industry associations, public sector and academia gathered at the IEA headquarters to discuss how improving data quality can drive policy support",
        "body":"With more than 150 delegates in attendance, discussions focused on how access to granular data on different aspects of heat pump installation and performance could help inform supportive policies to encourage further uptake among consumers.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Participants highlighted the lack of available technical, economic and performance data for heat pumps, which is often scarce and inconsistent across markets and regions. As a result, comparing progress across different countries is complicated and creates difficulties in identifying areas for further research and innovation. A closed afternoon session of the workshop followed a similar theme, examining how organisations can work together on data harmonisation and alignment. The IEA is paving the way for heat pump data-reporting, but further efforts are needed to build on regional best practices. International co-operation to agree on definitions needed for consistent data-reporting taxonomies and techniques will be crucial to this effort.\u00a0The importance of harmonising data collection and reporting on heat pumps will also continue to be advanced through the Heat Pump Coordination Group formed in 2024 by five IEA Technology Collaboration Programmes under the umbrella of the IEA\u2019s Committee on Energy Research and Technology. An agenda for the meeting and a recording of the webinar will be made available here.",
