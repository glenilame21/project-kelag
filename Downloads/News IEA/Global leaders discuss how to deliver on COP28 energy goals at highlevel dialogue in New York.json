        "body":"The COP29 Presidency and the International Energy Agency, in close partnership with the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Secretariat, today held the third in a series of High-Level Energy Transition Dialogues ahead of the COP29 climate change conference in Baku, Azerbaijan.The dialogue \u2013 which was co-chaired by COP29 President-Designate\u00a0Mukhtar Babayev\u00a0and IEA Executive Director\u00a0Fatih Birol\u00a0\u2013 took place in New York City alongside the UN General Assembly and Climate Week NYC. Hosted by the delegation of the European Union to the United Nations, it convened more than 60 energy and climate leaders from around the world to discuss how to implement the ambitious energy goals agreed last year in Dubai.Participants welcomed the analysis and recommendations from a new IEA report, From Taking Stock to Taking Action: How to implement the COP28 energy goals. Published today, its analysis finds that fully implementing the COP28 energy goals \u2013 which include pledges to triple global renewable capacity and double energy efficiency progress by 2030, substantially reduce methane emissions, and transition away from fossil fuels \u2013 would be transformative for the energy sector, driving down emissions and accelerating energy transitions around the world. However, the report emphasises that further international cooperation is needed to ensure the right enabling conditions. To unlock the full benefits of the tripling goal, countries need to make a concerted push to build and modernise 25\u00a0million\u00a0kilometres of electricity grids by 2030 and reach 1\u00a0500\u00a0gigawatts (GW) of energy storage capacity. Doubling efficiency, meanwhile, would require faster electrification in advanced economies, stronger efficiency standards in emerging economies and delivering universal access to clean cooking.The report also highlighted the importance of robustly reflecting the COP28 energy goals in the next round of Nationally Determined Contributions, or NDCs, under the Paris Agreement. This was a key topic of discussion during the High-Level Dialogue, along with how COP29 can support developing countries, which face additional challenges on implementation.Participants included Bahrain\u2019s Minister of Oil and Environment and Special Envoy for Climate Affairs Mohamed bin Mubarak Bin Daina, Brazil's Secretary for Climate Change\u00a0Ana Toni, Colombia\u2019s Minister of Mines and Energy Omar Andr\u00e9s Camacho, Indonesia\u2019s Minister for Maritime Affairs and Investment Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, Norway\u2019s Minister of Climate and Environment Tore Sandvik, Portugal's Minister for Environment and Energy\u00a0Maria da Gra\u00e7a Carvalho, Republic of the Marshall Islands Climate Envoy\u00a0Tina Stege, Singapore's Minister for Sustainability and Environment\u00a0Grace Fu, and United States Special Climate Envoy\u00a0John Podesta\u00a0\u2013 as well as UNFCCC Executive Secretary Simon Stiell, Special Adviser to the UN Secretary General on Climate Action Selwin Hart, COP26 President Alok Sharma, COP28 CEO\u00a0Adnan Amin, Green Climate Fund Executive Director\u00a0Mafalda Duarte and Hitachi CEO\u00a0Andreas Schierenbeck.\u201cThe energy pledges made by nearly 200 countries at COP28 would lead to a significantly more secure, sustainable and affordable energy system if they are fully implemented. Encouragingly, during today\u2019s High-Level Dialogue, we heard top decision makers discuss what needs to happen to turn COP promises into reality,\u201d said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol. \u201cTo meet the established targets, IEA analysis shows that the world must also scale up energy storage and grids, embrace all forms of efficiency, and ensure a just, orderly and equitable transition away from fossil fuels. As COP29 approaches, we will continue to convene stakeholders to build consensus and determine what can be done.\u201d\u201cCOP29 will be a critical opportunity to help turn the energy outcomes of the first Global Stocktake into concrete action,\u201d said COP29 President-Designate Mukhtar Babayev. \u201cInformed by close consultation with the IEA and by this series of high-level dialogues, we have introduced three key initiatives as part of the COP Presidency\u2019s Action Agenda. We are calling on everyone to sign up to the Energy Storage and Grids Declaration, the Green Energy Zones and Corridors Declaration, and the Hydrogen Declaration as signals of commitment to making our shared goals a reality.\u201dThe COP29 High-Level Energy Transition Dialogues aim to continue fostering international conversation around pathways to drive energy sector emissions to net zero and limit global warming to the Paris Agreement goal of 1.5 \u00b0C. They build on the success of the five Dialogues co-hosted with last year\u2019s COP28 Presidency, which made an important contribution to the major energy outcomes reached in Dubai. The next dialogue will take place next week in Foz do Igua\u00e7u, Brazil, during the gathering of G20 energy ministers, the 15th Clean Energy Ministerial and the ninth Mission Innovation Ministerial.",
