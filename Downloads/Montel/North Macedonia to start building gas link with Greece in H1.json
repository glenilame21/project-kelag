        "subtitle":"\n              (Montel) North Macedonia plans to sign a deal with Greece for a 1.5bcm natural gas interconnector this month and begin construction in the first half of the year, its energy ministry told Montel on Monday.\n            ",
        "body":"\nThe 123km-long hydrogen-ready interconnector, which is part of the country\u2019s efforts to diversify energy sources and use gas as a transitional fuel as it phases out coal, will have the potential to double the capacity if needed.\nGreece has already started construction, while North Macedonia will need to build a\u00a065km-long pipeline on its\u00a0territory, said the ministry.\n\u201cOur plan is for this gas pipeline to be a transit route for transporting gas from Greece to central Europe, which is why we had signed a memorandum on the Macedonia-Serbia interconnector and a feasibility study is underway,\u201d it added.\nCurrently, North Macedonia has\u00a0a\u00a00.8bcm\/year gas link with Bulgaria,\u00a0which it sources from Russia.\nNeed for new baseloadMeanwhile, the country plans to build two\u00a0gas-fired\u00a0power plants with a combined capacity of 400 MW to replace 730 MW of coal, which currently supplies two thirds of demand.\n\u201cUntil we build new baseload electricity generation capacity, we cannot abandon coal,\u201d said the ministry.\nThe previous government\u00a0before last April\u2019s general election\u00a0announced plans to invest EUR 3bn in building 1.7 GW of renewables with the aim of phasing out coal by 2030.\nThe ministry said that\u00a0by the start of this year,\u00a0the TSO had issued permits to private investors for the construction of 1 GW of renewables, while there are 9 GW in requests seeking grid connections.\nLast\u00a0September, it told Montel that the government also plans to invest in state-owned renewables generation capacity in a bid to reduce its dependency on private producers.\n",
