        "subtitle":"\n              (Montel) Swedish utility Vattenfall is open to signing long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) linked to new nuclear generation capacity if there is demand for them, according to its CEO Anna Borg.\n            ",
        "body":"\nIt was looking at building new nuclear capacity, she said,\u00a0without providing further details on where or how much, \u201cand when we do that [we will] have a discussion with industry partners on long-term agreements\u201d linked to it.\nDemand for PPAs with Vattenfall had so far been for new generation capacity, mostly onshore and offshore wind, she told reporters ahead of a competitiveness event organised by the European People\u2019s Party in the European Parliament on Wednesday evening.\nThe demand came mainly from companies with \u201cstrong balance sheets\u201d, as PPAs involved \u201cquite a lot of risk over a long period of time\u201d.\nSupporting PPAs with credit guarantees, for example, could make them accessible to smaller companies, she said.\nThe European Commission\u00a0said last week\u00a0the European Investment Bank would\u00a0offer EUR 500m\u00a0in guarantees for long-term PPAs in a\u00a0joint\u00a0pilot scheme this year.\nReduce riskThe goal was to reduce counterparty risk and so make PPAs accessible to more industrial consumers, the EC said in its affordable energy action plan published last week.\nThe EC wants to promote PPAs to give industry access to long-term stability in\u00a0electricity prices that is not linked to volatile gas prices. It is part of efforts to maintain the EU\u2019s industrial competitiveness with the rest of the world while decarbonising its economy.\nIn January,\u00a0Vattenfall signed\u00a0a 15-year PPA with chemicals group LyondellBasell to provide 450 GWh per year from 2028 from the 980 MW Nordlicht 1 offshore wind farm project in the North Sea.\nIt signed another 15-year PPA linked to the same project\u00a0in August last year\u00a0with German steel group Salzgitter for around 300 GWh per year.\u00a0\n",
