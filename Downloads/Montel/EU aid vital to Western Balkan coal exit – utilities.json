        "subtitle":"\n              (Montel) Western Balkan state-owned utilities will find it difficult to ditch coal-fired generation and transition to green energy without substantial EU aid, the SET industry event in Trebinje, Bosnia and Herzegovina heard late on Wednesday.\n            ",
        "body":"\n\u201cIf we are to reach decarbonisation targets, we need more support from the EU to carry out the transition of our coal regions,\u201d said Luka Petrovic, the manager of Bosnian power utility Ers.\nCoal currently accounts for\u00a060-95% of power generation in the Western Balkans, depending on the country, and 60% of the region\u2019s electricity exports.\nAs the state power provider, Ers must continue to operate two coal-fired plants, with a combined capacity of 600 MW, until sufficient replacement renewables capacity is online.\n\u201cBoth facilities now operate well below their capacity and we have been facing dozens of unplanned outages due to outdated equipment and low-quality coal,\u201d Petrovic told the event. \u201cWe cannot obtain loans from banks to revamp them or maintain them from our own operating funds.\u201d\nThe same sentiment was voiced by Dusan Zivkovic, the general manager of Serbian state-owned utility Eps, who said that the inflexibility of financial institutions was hampering decarbonisation efforts in the region.\n\u201cNo power utility in the Western Balkans will compromise its priorities \u2013 primarily energy security and social peace \u2013 for the sake of energy transition, [so] we need sustainable green transition financing mechanisms,\u201d said Zivkovic.\nCBAMHowever, the introduction of the EU\u2019s carbon tax \u2013 the carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) \u2013 in 2026 may force the region\u2019s utilities to decarbonise before the 2050 target date, Zivkovic and Petrovic said.\n\u201cThe price of [power] after CBAM becomes the reality might become a turning point for the governments\u2019 policies towards decarbonisation,\u201d said Zivkovic.\n",
