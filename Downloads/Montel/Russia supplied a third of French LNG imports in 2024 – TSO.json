        "body":"\n\u201cFrance serves as an entry point [to Europe] for LNG, and there is inevitably a transit of Russian LNG to European countries,\u201d said Sandrine Meunier, CEO of Natran, previously known as GRTgaz.\nAround 25% of France\u2019s\u00a0LNG imports were reexported\u00a0to neighbouring countries, she added.\nLast month, the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) reported an 81% rise in France\u2019s Russian LNG imports in 2024.\nAnd in January, a report by German and Ukrainian think tanks and NGOs found that the lack of transparency on the origin of gas once it was injected into the European grid allowed countries to deny responsibility for increasing Russian imports.\nEuropean dependence easingHowever, Meunier said that \u201cthe measures taken by the EU have been effective \u2013 Europe\u2019s dependence on Russian gas has decreased from 43% in 2021 to 18% in 2024\u201d.\nShe added that the region was \u201con the right trajectory\u201d to eliminate the use of Russian gas by 2027.\nOverall, France imported 271 TWh (27.7 bcm) of LNG in 2024, down by around 14% year on year, due to \u201clower consumption and a greater reliance on storage\u201d, Natran said. France\u00a0accounted for 24% of total European LNG imports last year.\nEarlier today, Meunier called for the filling of French gas storage capacity to start \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. The country\u2019s\u00a0gas\u00a0storage\u00a0levels are currently among the lowest in the EU, at 22%.\n",
