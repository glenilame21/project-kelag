        "body":"\nDuring a call with US president Donald Trump, Putin said Russian forces would halt strikes on Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure for 30 days but failed to agree to an unconditional ceasefire.\n\u201cWe agreed to an immediate ceasefire on all energy and infrastructure, with an understanding that we will be working quickly to have a complete ceasefire and ultimately an end to this very horrible war,\u201d Trump said, in a post on Truth Social.\nUkrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky called the news a \u201cpositive result\u201d, in a press briefing following the announcement.\n\u201c[But] they are not ready to end this war, and we can see that. They are not ready even for the first step, which is a ceasefire,\u201d he said.\nLingering suspicionUkrainian energy market participants also met the news with some scepticism.\n\u201cBombing cities is acceptable, yet bombing oil facilities is not \u2013 it sounds crazy,\u201d said a Kyiv-based energy trader, during an air-raid attack last night on the capital city.\nYuriy Onyshkiv, a Kyiv-based senior gas analyst at LSEG, also expressed caution.\n\u201cA couple of hours after the call, we got an air raid alert in Kyiv, with machinegun fire outside my flat, shooting down Russian Shahed drones,\u201d he said, adding \u201cI guess the ceasefire has not started yet.\u201d\nSince the beginning of the war, there have been more than 30 \u201cmassive\u201d missile and drone attacks on Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure, a spokeswoman for the energy ministry told Montel last month.\n\u201cIn addition, the energy system has been the target of daily targeted attacks\u2026the consequences of these attacks are significant,\u201d she said, noting that in 2024, 10 GW of generation capacity was lost.\n\u201cThere is no place, no region, no type of energy infrastructure that has not been hit during these attacks,\u201d she said.\n",
