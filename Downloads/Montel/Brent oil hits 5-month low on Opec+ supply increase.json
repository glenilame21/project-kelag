        "subtitle":"\n              (Montel) Oil prices fell on Tuesday \u2013 with Brent hitting a five-month low and WTI a three-month low \u2013 after Opec+ confirmed its return of supplies, while new US tariffs and the Russia-Ukraine turmoil added to uncertainty.\n            ",
        "body":"\nThe front-month contract for Brent crude North Sea oil was last seen down USD 1.01 at USD 70.61\/bbl, while the WTI equivalent dropped USD 0.82 to USD 67.54\/bbl.\nEarlier, Brent hit its lowest point since 1 October of USD 70.50\/bbl, while WTI fell to its lowest point since 10 December of USD 67.78\/bbl after both contracts settled down about 2% yesterday and were on track for a third consecutive session of falls.\n\u201cThe oil market is dealing with competing forces at the moment in the form of tariffs on one side and the likelihood of increased production on the other,\u201d Tim Waterer, chief market analyst at trading firm KCM, told Montel.\n\u201cIt is these expected increases on the supply side having the greater say when it comes to crude prices.\u201d\nOn Monday, oil producer alliance Opec+ confirmed its plan announced in December to start gradually phasing out production cuts of 2.2m bbl\/day on a monthly basis from April until the end of September 2026, whilst maintaining additional voluntary production cuts of around 1.7m bbl\/day until then.\nHowever, the group said it \u201cremains adaptable to evolving conditions\u201d and that the increase may be \u201cpaused or reversed subject to market conditions\u201d.\nTariffs beginBrent is trading close to 5% down for the year. Waterer said that the current oil prices were probably lower than where Opec+ would like them to be from a margin standpoint.\nHe said US president Donald Trump had \u201cmade it clear that he wants to see lower oil prices and one wonders whether Opec+ members such as Saudi Arabia and Russia may be taking relations with the US into account when making decisions about adding supply\u201d.\nThis came after Trump confirmed that his 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico would begin today and he also imposed an additional 10% tariff on Chinese imports on top of a 10% levy imposed last month.\n\u201cTariff measures from the US on Canada may well constrict supply but these worries are being more than offset by the prospect of Opec+ ramping up production come April,\u201d said Waterer.\nGeopolitical jittersTony Sycamore, market analyst at IG trading platform, also pointed to the US \u201cinvestigating lifting sanctions on Russia\u201d as another factor weighing on oil prices.\nMarket participants were also assessing recent geopolitical events after an unprecedented clash in the Oval Office on Friday between Trump, his vice president JD Vance and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky.\nYesterday, the US announced it was pausing military aid to Ukraine.\nAjay Parmar global analytics director at Icis, told Montel that even if a deal was reached with Russia, \u201cwe think it is unlikely to lead to a significant increase in Russian oil flows\u201d due to traders\u2019 caution.\n",
