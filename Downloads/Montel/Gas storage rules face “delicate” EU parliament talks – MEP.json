        "body":"\nThe EU targets were strategic given the geopolitical situation, German centre-right European People\u2019s Party (EPP) member Christian Ehler told reporters ahead of a competitiveness event in the parliament on Wednesday evening.\nBut Germany, for example, had been buying up gas at all costs to meet its target, with dramatic price impacts, he said.\n\u201cSo, we have to take a closer look at\u2026\u00a0the interaction between prices and the storage obligations,\u201d said Ehler, who is the EPP\u2019s spokesman on energy, industry and research.\nBoth the parliament and the EU Council of ministers, representing national governments, must agree on a common text for the proposal before it can become law.\nThe EPP, the parliament\u2019s largest political group, was in principle \u201cvery sceptical about substantial market or price interventions\u201d,\u00a0he said.\nEnergy prices would come down when the EU\u00a0increased investment in\u00a0renewables and infrastructure\u00a0and created\u00a0clear business cases for decarbonisation projects, he said, adding that policymakers should focus on that.\nPermanent optionThe EC said it wanted to extend the temporary storage filling targets by two years while it reviews the EU\u2019s overall energy security rules, including whether to propose making the targets permanent. It has not proposed any other changes to the current gas storage rules.\nThe EC originally proposed a binding annual target for EU gas storage facilities to be at least 80% full by 1 November in 2022, and at least 90% full by the same deadline for the following three years.\u00a0\nThe rules included non-binding intermediary targets for February, May, July and September, which the EC updates each year based on information provided by national governments.\nThe emergency, temporary legislation was intended to safeguard the bloc\u2019s winter gas supplies\u00a0in the wake of\u00a0Russian pipeline gas imports dropping dramatically after Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\nThe parliament and the EU council reached an informal agreement on the EC\u2019s original proposal in March 2022 in less than two months, when such processes normally take more than a year. This was to ensure the rules were known during the summer filling season ahead of the first binding target.\nThe current rules are due to expire on 31 December, implying the parliament and council must reach an agreement on the extension before then.\u00a0\n",
