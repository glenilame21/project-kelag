        "subtitle":"\n              (Montel) Italy\u2019s latest auction for renewable energy capacity saw strong demand, with allocated capacity exceeding the initial offer by 19%, according to state-owned energy services company GSE.\n            ",
        "body":"\nThe auction\u00a0\u2013 the 16th and final round under the country\u2019s subsidy programme launched in 2019 \u2013 awarded 457.6 MW of solar, wind and hydropower\u00a0capacity\u00a0out of the 384.4 MW on offer, GSE data showed late on Wednesday.\nClean energy projects with a\u00a0capacity\u00a0of 1 MW or more can access incentives through the\u00a0auction\u00a0scheme, while smaller ones access them via enrolment in special registries.\nOf the total\u00a0capacity\u00a0awarded, 423.9 MW were allocated via the\u00a0auction\u00a0process, while 33.7 MW were placed in registry enrolment.\nItaly has introduced a new scheme, called Fer X, which will use contracts for difference to support new renewable energy projects, with the first auction set for this spring.\nThe Fer X programme could account for around 50% of the country\u2019s installed capacity by 2030 as Italy targets 131 GW of renewables, up from the current 77 GW.\n",
