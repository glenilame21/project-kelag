        "subtitle":"\n              (Montel) The European Commission on Wednesday confirmed plans to delay companies\u2019 certificate purchasing obligation under the EU carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) from 2026 to 2027, alongside introducing an exemption threshold for small importers.\n            ",
        "body":"\nThe start date of CBAM certificate sales had been postponed to February 2027 to address \u201csignificant uncertainties\u201d relating to 2026, the official launch date of the mechanism, to give firms time to adapt.\nIt said these purchases would correspond to emissions embedded in goods imported into the EU in 2026 and should also reflect the price of EU ETS allowances of that year.\nHowever, while the purchase of CBAM certificates was deferred, the \u201cfinancial risk is not\u201d, said Dan Maleski of Redshaw Advisors, reflecting on the change, noting the obligation to account for embedded emissions was still scheduled for 1 January 2026.\nBut consultancy ClearBlue Markets said in a note that the move effectively reduced the compliance burden for entities.\n\u201cWe\u00a0do not expect significant impacts on CBAM hedging with EU ETS allowances, as the\u00a0phase-in rate and timeline remain unchanged.\u201d\nExemption thresholdAs part of the changes, the EC also sought to exempt small importers by introducing a new CBAM cumulative annual threshold of 50 tonnes per importer, it said.\nThis threshold was expected to eliminate obligations for approximately 182,000 \u2013 or 90% - of importers, mostly small and medium enterprises, while still covering more than 99% emissions in scope.\n\u201cThese are only around 1.3% of the total number of importers, meaning that a 50 tonnes mass-threshold would provide [reasonable] levels of planning certainty for more than 98.5% of all importers of CBAM goods,\u201d it said, given estimates that around 2,700 importers are importing at levels around 15% of 50 tonnes of mass.\nToday\u2019s announcement omits reference to an exemption threshold of 100 tonnes of embedded carbon dioxide, which was seen in a\u00a0leaked version\u00a0of the draft document earlier this week.\nThe commission said these simplifications would be followed by a comprehensive CBAM report in Q3 this year to evaluate a future extension of the mechanism to other sectors covered by the EU ETS, and later a legislative proposal on CBAM scope extension in Q1 2026.\n",
