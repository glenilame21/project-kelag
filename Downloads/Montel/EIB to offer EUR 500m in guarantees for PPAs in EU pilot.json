        "subtitle":"\n              (Montel) The European Investment Bank\u00a0is set to offer EUR 500m in guarantees for long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) in a pilot scheme with the European Commission this year.\n            ",
        "body":"\nThe exact amount would be confirmed later, and the goal was to reduce counterparty risk and so make PPAs accessible to more industrial consumers, the EC said in its\u00a0affordable energy action plan\u00a0released on Wednesday.\nThe EC said it would work with the EIB to promote PPAs, including cross-border options, in a \u201ctechnology-neutral\u00a0way\u201d.\n\u201cEffective\u201d CFDsBy the end of this year, it would also give EU national governments guidance on how to design \u201ceffective\u201d contracts for difference\u00a0(CFDs), including how to combine them with PPAs.\nTwo-way\u00a0CFDs\u00a0involve governments agreeing to guarantee a particular price for output from a supported energy project developer. If the market price falls below this strike price, the government makes up the difference. If the market price exceeds it, the developer must pay the government the difference.\nPPAs are long-term commercial contracts between a producer and an end-user for agreed volumes and prices.\nThey provided\u00a0a method to decouple electricity prices for end-users from high and volatile gas prices by offering long-term stability to both parties, the EC said.\nThe affordable energy action plan included eight approaches to lowering the EU\u2019s prices as the bloc seeks to maintain its competitiveness while moving to a net-zero emission economy.\u00a0\n",
