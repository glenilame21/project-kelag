        "subtitle":"\n              (Montel) Finnish and Estonian TSOs have said they will pursue legal action over the damaged 650 MW subsea power link Estlink 2 but have dropped their demand to seize the Eagle S vessel believed to be involved in the incident.\n            ",
        "body":"\nThe decision follows an assessment by the TSOs that the costs of seizing and maintaining the vessel would likely exceed its value,\u00a0Fingrid said in a statement on Sunday.\n\u201cWe do not see the seizure as financially viable, but we are absolutely not giving up on our claims for damages. We will seek compensation for the Estlink 2 cable damage from those responsible,\" said Fingrid CEO Asta Sihvonen-Punkka.\nThe operators said they would initially cover the repair costs of the interconnector themselves. Fingrid told Finnish paper Kauppalehti in December that repairs to the cable were estimated to cost around EUR 30m.\nThe subsea cable in the Gulf of Finland suffered damage in December 2024, disrupting power flows between Finland and Estonia. The outage is due to last until August.\nFinnish authorities investigated the incident, believing the Russian-linked Eagle S, a Cook Islands-registered oil tanker, had intentionally caused the cable ruptures by dragging its anchor.\nOn Sunday, the Finnish police said the vessel was being released because the legal basis for its continued detention no longer existed. The vessel departed Finnish waters on\u00a0Sunday\u00a0under the supervision of the Finnish Border Guard.\nThe authorities said they were investigating the vessel on suspicion of\u00a0\"aggravated criminal mischief\" and \u201caggravated disruption of telecommunications\u201d, adding that they aimed to conclude the investigation by the end of\u00a0April.\n",
