        "subtitle":"\n              (Montel) Hungary\u2019s industrial solar power output hit a record high of nearly 3.5 GW between 11:15-11:30 am on Saturday, allowing the country export 1.4 GW to southeast European neighbours, according to Montel Analytics.\n            ",
        "body":"\nThe high solar output helped raise Hungarian supply to over 5 GW on Saturday, despite nuclear output being reduced to 1.45 GW by outages and only 124 MW of wind. Demand on Saturday was 4.8 MW.\n\u201cThis record solar output made Hungary a net exporter during the day,\u201d said Gabor Szatmari, head of eastern European sales at\u00a0Montel Analytics, adding that Hungary\u2019s day-ahead prices remained at similar levels to those of its EU peers.\nHungary is traditionally a net importer of power, and during the evening peak demand period and solar ramp down, it returned to its import reliance, Szatmari noted.\nAccording to the country\u2019s power TSO Mavir, industrial solar capacity surpassed 4.2 GW in February, while household solar capacity exceeded 3.4 GW.\n\u201cIt will be fascinating to see how these periods evolve in 2026, as around 400 MW of new battery energy storage system capacity will come online in Hungary alone,\u201d said Szatmari.\n",
