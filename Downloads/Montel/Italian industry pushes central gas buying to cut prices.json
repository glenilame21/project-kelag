        "subtitle":"\n              (Montel) Italy\u2019s largest industry association is pushing a centralised gas purchasing system to lower domestic market costs by EUR 2-3\/MWh and generate potential savings of up to EUR 1.3bn a year, according to a document seen by Montel.\n            ",
        "body":"\nConfindustria\u2019s proposal involves securing about 6bcm\/year \u2013 roughly the volume imported from northern Europe \u2013 and to sell it daily at the TTF benchmark price.\n\u201cBy removing distortions from accumulated fixed transport and infrastructure costs, Italy could save EUR 1.3bn annually, boosting competition and European market integration,\u201d said the draft\u00a0document seen by Montel late on Wednesday.\nThe proposal outlines two measures to be adopted by the country\u2019s energy regulator Arera. The first involves removing entry costs at Passo Gries at the Swiss border \u2013 which Confindustria believes influences Italian PSV gas prices.\nHowever, the proposal may breach the EU\u2019s tariff network code, an industry expert told Montel,\u00a0wishing to speak on condition of anonymity.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not possible to apply a different tariff between one entry point and all the others,\u201d the expert said, predicting opposition from the EU\u2019s energy regulator Acer.\nThe second measure aims to secure supply through contracts between the gas TSO Snam and selected companies, which would receive incentives to sell gas daily at European market-based prices. If they generate excess profits, they will have to refund the surplus, according to the document.\nWhile this approach interferes with the market, it is feasible albeit complex and could be less effective than expected, the expert noted.\nWidening price spreadsThe proposals come amid widening PSV-TTF spreads. The PSV-TTF annual average spread hit EUR 2.02\/MWh in 2024, the highest since 2019.\nLast year, Italy imported about 10% of its gas demand, or 6bcm, via Passo Gries.\nItaly\u2019s industry representatives\u00a0plan to present the proposals to parliament in the coming weeks. \nAn approved measure could be included in Italy\u2019s recently passed energy aid package.\nLast month, Montel reported that Italy was exploring a solution without involving northern European countries.\n",
