        "subtitle":"\n              (Montel) Sunday\u2019s extreme balancing power price of EUR -10,000\/MWh in Denmark and Sweden was not caused by an error in the new joint Nordic market model for balancing, said Danish TSO Energinet on Monday.\n            ",
        "body":"\n\u201cThis is not an error in our new market. When there are very large imbalances, low liquidity and high prices on the last bids on the merit curve, the price becomes high,\u201d Kia Marie Jerichau, senior director at Energinet, told Montel.\nPrices for down regulation \u2013 where producers are paid to cut output or consumers recompensed\u00a0for boosting consumption \u2013 hit a record low of EUR -10,000\/MWh in eastern Denmark (DK2) and the southern Swedish bidding zones S3 and SE4 between 10.00-11.00 CET on Sunday.\nSeveral market participants said on social media that last week\u2019s move to a joint Nordic market for balancing had led to increased price volatility.\nFundamental issuesBut Energinet said both Sunday\u2019s price crash\u00a0and the EUR 4,827\/MWh spike for up regulation \u2013\u00a0where producers are paid to boost output or consumers to reduce production \u2013\u00a0seen in western Denmark (DK1) on Thursday, were caused by fundamental issues, not the new algorithm used to attract automatic bids for frequency reserves.\nSoaring prices on Thursday were caused by an error in the Norwegian power grid, which reduced the power flow to Denmark and thus created a greater need for up regulation, Jerichau said.\n\u201cWe are, of course, closely monitoring it and checking for irregularities in pricing and whether our own implementation is functioning correctly,\u201d she added.\n\u201cWe are also working to increase transparency and help market participants in the learning process we are all undergoing.\u201d\n",
