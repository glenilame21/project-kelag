        "subtitle":"\n              (Montel) Spain could see a \u201cfairly high\u201d number of hours with negative power prices in 2025, in line with 2024, due to the sustained deployment of renewables\u00a0capacity, consultancy Aurora Energy Research\u00a0said on Wednesday.\n            ",
        "body":"\nHowever,\u00a0the firm\u00a0did not expect prices to be \u201cdeeply negative\u201d, given the limited number of bids in the market below EUR -3\/MWh, said Christina Rentell, its head of research for Iberia and France, during a\u00a0webinar.\nSpain saw a total of 247 hours with negative power prices in 2024 and an average spot power price of EUR 63.03\/MWh,\u00a0as the\u00a0country\u2019s\u00a0boom in renewable generation continued.\u00a0\nOther analysts had already pointed to a likely continuation of negative prices this year, as\u00a0the bullish impact of lower\u00a0hydropower\u00a0output\u00a0would be offset by\u00a0the 7.7 GW\u00a0of new green capacity\u00a0added in Spain\u00a0last year.\u00a0\nFurther out, Spain could see a reduction in the frequency of negative prices from 2028 onwards with the addition of more flexibility\u00a0infrastructure, such as batteries, according to Aurora Energy Research.\nAlthough there were only 247 hours clearing\u00a0at\u00a0below-zero\u00a0prices\u00a0last year, 25% of the\u00a0output bid\u00a0by\u00a0producers\u00a0in\u00a0Spain\u2019s wholesale\u00a0power market was at negative prices, said Javier Pamos,\u00a0product manager at the company.\n",
