        "subtitle":"\n              (Montel) The European Commission\u00a0will\u00a0help Ukraine buy gas and fully integrate its power market with the EU\u2019s, it said as it unveiled a new support package intended to improve energy security in the war-torn country.\n            ",
        "body":"\nThe EC would use EU funds, particularly the Ukraine Facility set up to provide financial support from 2024 to 2027, to ensure\u00a0the country has\u00a0\u201cample gas reserves\u201d, it said on Sunday, without giving details.\nUkraine\u2019s gas storage levels have more than halved on the year to reach a record low of 2.39bcm, or just 7.3% of capacity, Montel reported last week.\nThe plans to help fully integrate\u00a0the power markets of Ukraine and Moldova\u00a0into the EU\u2019s by spring 2027 relied on Ukraine rapidly fulfilling its commitments to update legal, regulatory and public service obligations,\u00a0the EC said.\nThe support package would also speed up renewable energy investments, adding up to 1.5 GW of power generation capacity, which would represent a 25% increase from the current level.\nThe EU has already provided more than EUR 2bn\u00a0to help Ukraine improve the resilience of its energy system\u00a0since\u00a0Russia\u2019s invasion\u00a0three years ago.\nSince September, support provided by the bloc\u00a0has helped to repair 1.8 GW of thermal power plant capacity, roll out wind and solar projects, and increase Ukraine\u2019s commercial capacity to import electricity from the EU to 2.1 GW from 1.7 GW, plus an emergency buffer of an extra 250 MW, the EC said.\nThe EC and Ukraine have also agreed to cooperate more on developing renewable gases to improve energy security for the EU and support investment in Ukraine.\nEnergy independenceRussian attacks against Ukrainian energy infrastructure showed why achieving energy independence was so important, and why it was a strategic goal for both the EU and Ukraine, said EU energy commissioner Dan Jorgensen in a statement on the new support package.\n\u201cMore homegrown renewables and better interconnections amongst us is the best guarantee for a better and safer future together,\u201d he said.\nThe EC is due to\u00a0publish a roadmap on 26 March outlining how the\u00a0EU\u00a0can phase out its remaining Russian energy imports by 2027.\u00a0\n",
