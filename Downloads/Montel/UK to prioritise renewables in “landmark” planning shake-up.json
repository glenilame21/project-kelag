        "subtitle":"\n              (Montel) The UK will prioritise renewable energy projects that are ready to connect to the grid through a \u201clandmark\u201d planning and infrastructure bill set to be presented to parliament this week, the government said in a statement late on Monday.\n            ",
        "body":"\nThe \u201cfirst ready, first connected\u201d process will replace the current system in which projects such as solar farms that are ready to connect could wait up to 10 years for a grid connection, it added.\nThis flawed process was preventing viable infrastructure from being able to connect and has led to speculative projects clogging up the grid connections queue, it said.\nThe new system was expected to unlock growth by bringing forward GBP 200bn of investment and protect households from price spikes arising from the global energy market, the government said.\n\u201cThe only way to get Britain off dependency on fossil fuel markets controlled by dictators is with clean homegrown power that we control,\u201d said energy secretary Ed Miliband.\n\u201cBy taking on a broken planning system that puts the brakes on growth, this government is driving forward with our clean energy superpower mission and plan for change.\u201d\n",
