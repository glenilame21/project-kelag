        "subtitle":"\n              (Montel) Croatia is preparing a contract for difference (CFD) financing model to incentivise geothermal investments, the country\u2019s economy minister Ante Susnjar told journalists at an industry conference in Zagreb on Tuesday.\n            ",
        "body":"\nThe recently updated national energy and climate plan (NECP) drew criticism for envisaging only 68 MW of geothermal capacity by 2030, despite there being potential for far higher. However, investors say the authorities need to hurry if even this goal is to be met.\nSusnjar provided little detail about the CFD model but said that it has been discussed with the energy market operator Hrote and the regulator, Hera.\nHowever, he noted that Croatia expects the EU to start funding geothermal projects from 2027. \u201cUntil then, we have the financial capacity to finance the projects that will be ready,\u201d Susnjar said.\nInvestors\u2019 concerns\u201cWe need to sign CFDs as soon as next year if we are to build the most advanced projects and connect them to the grid by 2030,\u201d Dragutin Domitrovic \u2013 the CEO of IGeoPen, a subsidiary of the UK\u2019s Star Energy \u2013 told Montel.\nIGeoPen is developing a 10-15 MW geothermal power plant in northeastern Croatia, while Croatia\u2019s Enna Next and Turkey\u2019s Soyak are also developing geothermal projects with a combined capacity of 118 MW.\nUnder current regulations, Croatian projects that are already in the construction phase do not qualify for incentives. After signing a CFD, investors have four years to build the project.\nDomitrovic also pointed out that investors are still waiting for the energy regulator to adopt a new grid connection fee, which could have a significant impact on the cost of new projects. Lobby groups said that several GW of capacity in the pipeline are on hold because of this uncertainty.\n",
