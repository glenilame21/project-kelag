        "subtitle":"\n              (Montel) The European Commission has cancelled plans to present a roadmap on\u00a026\u00a0March\u00a0on how the bloc will phase out\u00a0Russian fossil fuels by 2027, according to its latest agenda.\n            ",
        "body":"\n\u201cWe have no new timing to share,\u201d a spokeswoman for the EC told Montel, who noted work on the roadmap nevertheless \u201ccontinues\u201d.\nEnergy commissioner Dan Jorgensen\u00a0reiterated last week\u00a0that Europe needed to be independent of\u00a0Russian fossil fuels, as such purchases were \u201cindirectly helping Putin finance his war\u201d.\n\u201cSince the war began, we have imported fossil fuels from Russia for an amount equal to the cost price of 2,400 F35 fighter jets. This will obviously not stand,\u201d\u00a0he said.\nThe roadmap, which was announced in November 2024 by Jorgensen, was initially scheduled for\u00a026\u00a0February,\u00a0but was\u00a0postponed in January\u00a0to 26 March.\nIn its\u00a0competitiveness compass strategy paper\u00a0unveiled in January, the EC said the roadmap would set out \u201clawful measures towards ending Russian energy imports\u201d.\nThe roadmap was intended to deliver the EC\u2019s RePowerEU plan introduced in 2022 in response to\u00a0Russia\u2019s full-scale\u00a0invasion of Ukraine\u00a0in February that year. At the time, the EC said it wanted to end Russian gas imports by 2027.\u00a0\nRussian pipeline gas imports to the EU have plummeted since the war began but LNG imports from the country hit a record high 20bcm in 2024.\nSecurity plansMeanwhile,\u00a0the EC\u00a0still\u00a0plans to publish the EU\u2019s preparedness union strategy on 26 March, which\u00a0aims\u00a0to develop a common, cross-sector approach to tackle security threats across the bloc.\nIt\u00a0will\u00a0be followed on 1 April by its new European internal security strategy, which seeks to protect critical infrastructure, enhance cybersecurity and tackle hybrid threats\u00a0amid recent attacks on European\u00a0power\u00a0and\u00a0data\u00a0cables.\n",
