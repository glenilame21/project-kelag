        "body":"\nThe decrease was primarily due to lower earnings from origination, where results were exceptionally high in 2023, the state-owned utility said in its full-year financial report.\nFrom a historical perspective, its markets segment results were still good, it added.\nThe group posted earnings before interest and taxes (Ebit) from its overall operations of NOK 26.5bn last year, down from EUR 41.4bn a year ago, which also reflects significantly lower wholesale power prices.\nThe average Nordic day-ahead power price fell to a four-year low of EUR 36.07\/MWh last year, down from EUR 56.45\/MWh a year earlier.\nThe group generated 66.3 TWh of electricity in 2024, up from 61.9 TWh in 2023.\n(EUR 1 = NOK 11.81)\n",
