        "subtitle":"\n              (Montel) Global LNG markets are seeing increased volatility, with well-supplied players sitting it out and more exposed ones tracking sentiment around diplomatic efforts to end the war in Ukraine, analysts told Montel on Monday.\n            ",
        "body":"\nPrices of the liquid fuel track those on European gas hubs, which last week plunged and then rose sharply on news around European plans to ease storage targets and expectations surrounding talks aimed at ending the war in Ukraine.\nHowever, Friday\u2019s globally broadcast spat between the US and Ukrainian presidents further cemented the sentiment-driven dynamics, analysts said.\n\u201cThe market is back in headline trading mode, as last week\u2019s selloff on news that the EU might relax storage targets was overshadowed by [the] deterioration of progress on a peace deal,\u201d Rabobank energy strategist Florence Schmit told Montel.\n\u201cGeopolitics is driving the TTF jump this morning, as a return [of] Russian flows still seems a long way off after Friday\u2019s show at the White House,\u201d she added.\nThe benchmark front-month contract eased from earlier gains and was last seen up 3% to EUR 45.70\/MWh.\nSitting it outGlobal LNG markets are therefore set to be driven by short-term requirements to cover portfolios, more than fundamentals, analysts agreed.\nAsian buyers \u201cwill sit it out as long as they can\u201d amid expectations of lower demand and prices this summer, said Schmit.\nHowever, it will depend on exposure, noted Lu Ming Pang, senior gas and LNG Asia Pacific analyst at Rystad Energy.\n\u201cAll LNG players are going to have to optimise on all the positions that they have built\u2026 to eke out as much value as possible, so [it will vary depending] on the player\u2019s existing portfolio,\u201d he told Montel.\nThose with a long position\u00a0\u201ccan afford to wait if they have already secured enough long-term volumes\u201d, leaving less\u00a0\u201cto the whims of the spot markets\u201d, said Pang.\nHowever, those\u00a0\u201clooking to capitalise on short-term gains via spot deals will be following Russia-Ukraine relations very closely\u201d, as a ceasefire agreement would \u201cincrease the chances of resumed flows through Ukraine, which would relax global gas and LNG prices\u201d, he said.\nIn the meantime, prices will continue to rise and fall with sentiment and speculation, Pang said, and \u201cplayers that require those cargoes urgently will still need to come into the market\u201d.\nAsian\u00a0LNG\u00a0imports plunged by 16% on the month in February, and by 9% on the year, to 20.3m tonnes.\n",
