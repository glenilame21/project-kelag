        "subtitle":"\n              (Montel) The introduction of 15-minute windows for intraday power trading in Spain \u2013 as opposed to the 60 minutes currently \u2013 was set to curb liquidity, several analysts told Montel on Wednesday.\n            ",
        "body":"\nThe change, to be introduced in Spain and the Nordic region from next Tuesday and other European countries from June \u2013 should enable market participants to balance intermittent renewable generation \u201cmore precisely\u201d but they would need to make fewer transactions, said Jean-Paul Harreman, director at Montel Analytics.\nUltimately, there could be \u201clower liquidity in intraday auctions\u201d, he added.\nProgressive problemMeanwhile, progressive implementation of the new measure over the next three months would cause a \u201cdecoupling\u201d between bids in the daily market \u2013 still in hourly blocks until 11 June \u2013 and those in the intraday market \u2013 which would move to 15-minute blocks next week \u2013 said Rodrigo Garcia, an analyst at Optimize Energy.\n\u201cMatching hourly blocks with quarter hourly blocks is not always easy\u201d, which could compound the liquidity issue, he added.\nBoth analysts also pointed to additional operational hurdles for traders amid increased volumes of data due to the change to 15-minute trading blocks.\nThe above issues along with the absence of portfolio bidding \u2013 common in other European markets and which allows producers to group their generation or purchase units instead of making individual bids \u2013 meant \u201cmore operational complexity, potential price volatility and reduced market liquidity\u201d, said Harreman.\n",
