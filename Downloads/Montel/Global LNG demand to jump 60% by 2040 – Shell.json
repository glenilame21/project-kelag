        "body":"\nConsumption of the liquid fuel will reach between 630-718m tonnes (860-980bcm) by 2040, with the higher forecast around 5% higher than Shell\u2019s outlook last year.\nGlobal LNG trade reached 407m tonnes in 2024, although the annual growth of 2m tonnes was the lowest in a decade.\nShell reckoned that an additional 170m tonnes will be available by 2030 but warned that \u201cstart-up timings of new LNG projects are uncertain\u201d.\nIn 2025, supply is forecast to grow between 17-26m tonnes, in step with demand.\nChina and India are set to see the highest demand growth in the long term, while Algeria, Egypt, Malaysia and Indonesia will reduce net exports of the fuel.\n\u201cEurope and Japan will continue to require LNG to fill a widening gap between energy diversification ambitions and actual investment levels,\u201d Shell said.\n",
