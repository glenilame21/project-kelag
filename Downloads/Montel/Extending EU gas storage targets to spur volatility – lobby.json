        "body":"\n\u201cThe risk of further intervention\u2026 by member states in how they choose to apply obligations will deter commercial storage filling,\u201d the traders\u2019 lobby said.\nThis was in response to plans by the European Commission to extend its gas storage regulation in 2026, but with more flexible filling targets.\u00a0\nSome member states had previously criticised the current filling targets for distorting the market by pushing summer gas prices significantly above winter prices.\nAccording to the existing rules, which expire at the end of the year, EU-wide storage must reach 90% of capacity by 1 November, with intermediary targets to be met in February, May, July and September.\u00a0\nThe targets were introduced in 2022 as part the EU\u2019s emergency measures in response to Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\nMarket distortionEnergy Traders Europe said it was concerned about the \u201cdistortive nature\u201d of the current rules, noting the continued emphasis on storage filling, rather than a broader approach to energy security, had contributed to a \u201cconcentration of activity in this area\u201d.\n\u201cMember states are trapped between having a very expensive form of security, or saving money but leaving storage underfilled,\u201d said Doug Wood, chairman of the gas committee at Energy Traders Europe.\n\u201cThe most helpful action now would be to restore some calm by ruling out a possible extension of storage obligations to 2026 and beyond,\u201d Wood said.\u00a0\nA spokesperson for the German economy ministry\u00a0told Montel earlier this month\u00a0that it also supported \u201cless rigid\u201d storage level requirements.\n\u201cThe European Commission has indicated that it will address this issue,\u201d the spokesperson added.\nNew EU gas storage rules could be agreed by June this year, Poland\u2019s minister for industry, Marzena Czarnecka, who represents the EU presidency, said last week.\n",
