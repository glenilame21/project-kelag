        "subtitle":"\n              (Montel) Hungary is set to secure natural gas supplies from Romania as it looks to diversify its energy sources, the country\u2019s foreign minister Peter Szijjarto said on Monday.\n            ",
        "body":"\nAt a joint news conference with Romania\u2019s energy minister Sebastian Burduja, Szijjarto said Hungarian gas companies are already negotiating contracts, while Burduja noted that Romania\u2019s 100bcm\u00a0Neptun\u00a0Deep gas project in the Black Sea will turn the country into a net exporter.\nThe project is set to be completed by 2027, said Burduja. However, neither of the officials disclosed potential volumes.\nNeptun Deep \u201cwill be the only fresh gas source in the region that can contribute to energy diversification\u201d, Szijjarto said after the two signed an agreement on measures to safeguard the security of gas supply.\n\u201cRomania has significant production capacity which will grow in the future, it also has a serious storage capacity\u2026 thus, Hungary has a serious interest in finding a basis for gas solidarity with Romania,\u201d he said.\nSzijjarto noted that in 2024 the gas interconnector between the two countries was used to trade a total of 1.8bcm, against total capacity of 2.6bcm\/year.\nAlternative sourcesEfforts by southeast European countries to use gas as a transitional fuel are putting pressure on them to secure alternative sources of supply following Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, and the subsequent end of gas transit flows via Ukraine in January.\nTwo-thirds of Hungary\u2019s gas imports currently come from Russia. Last year, Hungary imported 7.5bcm of Russian gas via the TurkStream pipeline and additional amounts via Romania. It also produces 1-1.5bcm\/year of gas domestically.\nBurduja said in January that Romania would export around 1bcm of gas from Neptun Deep to a German company via Austria\u2019s OMV, as Europe continues to seek replacements for Russian supply.\n",
