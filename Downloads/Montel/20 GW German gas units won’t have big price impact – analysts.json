        "subtitle":"\n              (Montel) The plans of Germany\u2019s expected new government to bring 20 GW of gas-fired power generation capacity online by 2030 will have a minor impact on prices, Berlin-based experts from Montel Analytics said on Monday.\n            ",
        "body":"\n\u201cI have little hope that they would significantly reduce electricity prices in situations of scarcity, such as a dunkelflaute [a period of low wind and solar output],\u201d said Matthis Brinkhaus, senior analyst at Montel.\nGermany is set for a new government coalition following elections last month, and the Christian Democrats (CDU\/CSU) and Social Democrats (SPD)\u00a0announced the power plant plan over the weekend, Montel reported earlier. Achieving the reduction of power prices is set to be a key government goal. \nBrinkhaus said that because the proposed gas-fired plants would need to make their money in a limited number of running hours, they might bid into the day-ahead market with a premium that would \u201cnot necessarily reflect the marginal costs\u201d.\nLow single digitsThe outgoing government planned to bring 10 GW of new gas-fired capacity online, and the additional volume foreseen under the new plan should see power prices dampened by a low single-digit percentage, according to Montel Analytics calculations.\nBrinkhaus expected increased import and storage capacity to be a bigger driver for reducing power prices.\nHowever, the Berlin-based Enervis consultancy saw a possible price impact of more than EUR 10\/MWh by 2030, since investors were waiting for such a scheme to bring gas-fired projects forward, senior consultant Tim Hoefer said.\nThe EEX exchange\u2019s 2030 power price for Germany last settled at EUR 67.20\/MWh.\nTight scheduleBuilding 20 GW of new capacity by 2030 also seemed \u201crather unrealistic\u201d, said Christoph Maurer, managing director of Aachen-based consultancy Consentec.\nThe 20 GW was closer to actual supply security needs than the outgoing government\u2019s 10 GW target, but the latter was also aiming for a capacity market to finance additional units, according to Maurer.\nA capacity market scheme \u2013 which pays units for their availability in the market \u2013 would probably be easier to negotiate with the European Commission in terms of state aid, said Maurer.\nHoefer also said that gaining EC approval could be problematic, adding that the gas-fired units would need to fit in with decarbonisation plans.\nGermany is aiming to achieve climate neutrality in 2045, with a key element of the plan being the strong expansion of wind and solar power generation capacity, which needs to be accompanied by back-up capacity for times of very low renewables generation.\n",
