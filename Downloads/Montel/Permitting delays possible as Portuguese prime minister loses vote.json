        "subtitle":"\n              (Montel) Firms may face permitting delays for energy projects in Portugal after prime minister Luis Montenegro lost a confidence vote in the parliament on Tuesday, following a scandal related to his family business dealings.\n            ",
        "body":"\nThe president, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, must now decide whether to call\u00a0snap\u00a0elections, which\u00a0could be held\u00a0in mid-May, according to local media.\nOne market participant told Montel that he expected to see a possible delay of \u201cup to six months\u201d for projects that need new\u00a0permits, as the acting government would be unable to take a stance on important energy issues.\n\u201cTransition will continue\u201dHowever, he was optimistic that a new government would be formed before the summer, and that it would continue the country\u2019s current energy policy without major changes. \u201cThe energy transition will continue\u201d in Portugal, he added.\nAmong the pending regulatory issues is the launch of the country\u2019s first offshore wind auction, which is expected this year. \nThis\u00a0measure\u00a0has been pending since the conservative Democratic Alliance won the general election a year ago, after the previous socialist premier, Antonio Costa, was forced to resign following a scandal involving green hydrogen. \nThe latest political crisis in Portugal began last month when it was alleged that a firm owned by\u00a0Montenegro\u2019s family received payments from other companies while he was in office, according to local media.\n",
