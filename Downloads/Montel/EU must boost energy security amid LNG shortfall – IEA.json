        "body":"\n\u201cEuropean energy systems face a challenging year ahead as the continent emerges from this winter with lower-than-average levels of gas in storage,\u201d the Paris-based agency said on Sunday.\nIt said options included signing long-term contracts \u201cto provide more stable supplies and strengthening the transatlantic partnership on LNG trade\u201d.\nEU gas storage was last seen just below 41% full, 23.1 percentage points lower on the year, according to Gas Infrastructure Europe.\nThe IEA said global gas markets were unlikely to loosen up until well into 2026 when a \u201chuge wave of new LNG supply\u201d would begin to hit international markets.\nGas remained \u201cessential\u201d for the continent\u2019s energy security, despite \u201cclear signs of structural [demand] decline\u201d, it said. Last year marked the fifth consecutive year of annual declines in European gas demand, with an 8% fall from 2023.\nHowever, waiting for new planned LNG capacities was \u201cnot a viable strategy\u201d for European economies, the IEA warned, with new projects in the US and Qatar set to come online gradually from 2026.\nMore gas requiredInstead, the EU needed to implement additional measures to strengthen energy security and to pay \u201cparticular attention\u201d to gas supply resilience, according to the agency.\nAlthough it expected global LNG supply to rise 5% this year compared to 1.5% in 2024, meeting EU gas storage targets before next winter would require \u201cmuch bigger inflows of gas than in the two previous years\u201d.\nSince Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the EU has rolled out measures to tame volatile energy prices and protect consumers, including gas storage obligations and joint gas purchasing.\n\u201cWe will have a heated summer, with fierce competition for every drop of LNG,\u201d Greg Molnar, an IEA gas analyst who co-authored the comment, said on LinkedIn.\nEarlier this month, he told Montel that Europe could require around 45% more gas this summer to meet injection targets.\nEurope\u2019s benchmark front-month TTF gas contract last traded down by EUR 1.81 at EUR 45.39\/MWh on Ice Endex. Earlier, it fell to EUR 45.21\/MWh, its lowest on a rolling basis since 10 January.\u00a0\n",
