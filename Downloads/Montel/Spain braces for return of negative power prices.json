        "subtitle":"\n              (Montel) Excess renewables generation is set to drag Spanish\u00a0power prices into negative territory again in coming sessions, even as soon as Saturday, analysts have told Montel.\n            ",
        "body":"\n\u201cSaturday looks likely to see negative prices in Spain\u201d, with hours of \u201czero or maybe EUR -1\/MWh\u201d, said Jean-Paul Harreman, director at Montel Analytics.\nThis could be the first instance of below-zero prices in the country since the EUR -0.01\/MWh seen at 14:00-15:00 CET on 20 October, data from the Omie exchange showed. Near-zero prices and green output curtailments became widespread last year, putting the profitability of renewables investments at risk.\nHarreman pointed to increased wind and hydropower production on Saturday in the Iberian nation, coupled with muted demand.\nWind generation is expected to average 15.7 GW on Saturday, 6 GW above the seasonal norm, and hydropower 5.2 GW, or 0.6 GW above normal, according to Montel Analytics. Meanwhile, demand looked poised to average 25.5 GW, around the standard level for this time of year.\nSpain\u2019s gas-fired fleet would only provide \u201caround 2 GW\u201d of generation, similar to the exceptionally low levels seen last year from 4-11 April, when the country started to see negative prices, Harreman said.\nMeanwhile, Iberdrola expected to halve the output of its 1.1 GW Valencian reactor Cofrentes from 09:00-12:00 CET on both Saturday and\u00a0Sunday, according to Remit data. Spain started to modulate nuclear production in 2023 in a bid to leave more room to integrate renewables.\nNot there yet?Spain was likely to see near-zero prices over the weekend due to increased renewables output, said Jose Carlos Antoniles, power analyst at Spain retailer Fortia Energia.\nFortia\u2019s models did not forecast prices below zero this weekend, but negative prices during peak solar production hours were probably \u201caround the corner, in the coming weeks\u201d, he added.\n\u201cWe are raising our warnings, observing the situation,\u201d said Rafael Alcala, partner at consultancy Trebol Energia. He noted, however,\u00a0that negative price forecasts for this weekend were \u201cnot so clear\u201d due to relatively high demand.\n\u201cWe do believe there will be very low prices, near EUR 10\/MWh. That\u2019s crystal clear,\u201d Alcala added.\nExport curbsThe green flurry expected in Spain over the weekend looked poised to coincide with cuts to interconnection capacity towards France, so \u201cthe excess will not be exported\u201d across the Pyrenees, Harreman said.\nFrance was also set to see\u00a0strong wind output, potentially leading to negative prices late on Saturday and early on Sunday, \u201calthough it may just be able to get rid of the excess if other countries don\u2019t have as much wind,\u201d Harreman said.\n\u201cWe expect significant modulation of nuclear reactors in France,\u201d he added.\nFrance often has\u00a0difficulties transporting decentralised solar and wind generation, as well as southern power flows from Spain. This\u00a0led to curtailments in the northbound direction during 28% of the hours in 2024.\nAvailable capacity for power exports from Spain to France had already dropped from 2 GW to just 0.5 GW by 08:00 CET on Wednesday, according to TSO data.\n",
