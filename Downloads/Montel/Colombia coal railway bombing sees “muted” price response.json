        "subtitle":"\n              (Montel) A bombing of a key coal railway in Colombia \u2013 Europe\u2019s largest thermal coal supplier \u2013 could result in some export disruption but have a limited impact on European coal prices, market sources said on Thursday. \n            ",
        "body":"\nThe attack on the railway line linking the key Cerrejon mining complex with its export hub at Puerto Bolivar brought railings to a standstill on Tuesday, according to the Cerrejon mining firm, which is owned by the Anglo-Swiss trading house Glencore.\nDamage to rail infrastructure was \u201cbeing assessed\u201d, it said in a note.\nA source close to the situation said rail operations were still suspended as of Wednesday evening.\n\u201cStocks [at the time of the attack] were enough to load one or two vessels, not more. So, if it takes more than two days to fix, they will have to stop loading operations,\u201d he added.\nA ship loaded with 170,000t of thermal coal left the port on Wednesday, according to Kpler vessel-tracking data.\nStock drawdownToby Hassall, lead coal analyst at LSEG, said he expected the rail suspension to last for \u201ca few days\u201d.\nThis would result in a drawdown of stocks at Puerto Bolivar, he added, noting maximum storage capacity at the port was 610,000t.\n\u201cI expect export volumes will be somewhat impacted and a supply risk premium to be priced-in, but given current soft demand it\u2019s likely to be a relatively muted response,\u201d Hassall added.\nThe front-month API 2 coal contract changed hands last up USD 0.65 on the day at USD 98.50\/t, which was around 10% higher than the one-year low of USD 89.20\/t seen on 3 March on Ice Futures.\n\u201cCerrejon was able to fix railway damage quite fast in the recent incidents and volumes have not been particularly strong since January,\u201d said Firat Ergene, senior dry bulk analyst at Kpler.\n\u201cAssuming this does not escalate into a prolonged blockade, I think there should be more than enough coal [from elsewhere] to cover the shipment line up for up to two weeks,\u201d he added.\nColombia was by far Europe\u2019s largest supplier of thermal coal last year, shipping around 8.3m tonnes across the Atlantic \u2013 or nearly 40% of all imports \u2013 compared with 3.8m tonnes from the region\u2019s second-largest supplier, South Africa, and 3.4m tonnes from the US, Kpler data showed.\nA Glencore spokesman declined to comment on the situation.\n",
