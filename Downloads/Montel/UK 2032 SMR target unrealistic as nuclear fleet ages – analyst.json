        "subtitle":"\n              (Montel) The UK government\u2019s target to roll out small modular reactors (SMRs) by 2032 is \u201cincredibly optimistic\u201d and the ageing nuclear fleet could lead to increased price volatility in the interim, an energy analyst has told Montel.\n            ",
        "body":"\nPrime minister Keir Starmer said earlier this month he expected SMRs to be in operation in the UK by 2032 and to become a common sight across the country.\nHowever, Tom Betts, senior analyst at Aurora Energy Research, said that despite the government relaxing planning restrictions on where SMRs can be built, this deadline is unrealistic.\n\u201cThe government expects SMRs on the grid by 2032, but we think that\u2019s incredibly optimistic,\u201d Betts said. \u201c2040s is probably more realistic. This technology hasn\u2019t been proven at scale yet, and as with any new development, there\u2019s a long road ahead.\u201d\nThe UK has turned to SMRs \u2013 with smaller, more flexible designs that are easier to deploy than traditional large-scale plants \u2013 as its nuclear fleet ages. Nuclear currently supplies about 15% of the country\u2019s electricity. Several reactors, originally designed with 30-year lifespans, are already far beyond that limit.\n\u201cMore volatility\u201dAlthough EDF has extended the lifetimes of four key reactors \u2013 Hartlepool, Torness and two at Heysham \u2013 these extensions will only last until 2027 and 2030.\nWithout a proven track record and secure financing, it remains uncertain whether SMRs can be deployed in the manner laid out by the government, said Betts.\n\u201cNuclear is just a much more complex investment than renewables,\u201d Betts said. \u201cFor instance, the government has a huge stake in Sizewell C and that\u2019s because private investors aren\u2019t lining up to fund these projects. It\u2019s a risky proposition and the pace of progress is hard to predict.\u201d\nWith projects like the 3.2 GW Hinkley Point C pushed back multiple times, Betts said it is unclear whether SMRs can step in quickly enough to fill the void.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no perfect overlap between these reactors shutting down and new reactors coming online. That creates a gap in nuclear capacity by 2030,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAnd if Hinkley is delayed further, there\u2019s no real backup plan. The market will just adjust by running gas CCGTs [combined cycle gas turbines] more often, meaning more volatility.\u201d\n",
