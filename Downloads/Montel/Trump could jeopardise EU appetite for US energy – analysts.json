        "subtitle":"\n              (Montel) Growing US hostility towards Europe could see the bloc turn its back on fresh transatlantic energy deals, amid concerns about the reliability of a country until now considered a staunch ally, analysts told Montel.\n            ",
        "body":"\n\u201cThere\u2019s a sense in Europe that the US is out to divide the EU, that the US wants to do bilateral deals with weaker partners \u2013 you have to react to that,\u201d said Henning Gloystein, director of energy, climate and resources at Eurasia Group.\n\u201cIt\u2019s started with defence, but it\u2019s spilling into the energy sector,\u201d he said, noting that\u00a0European governments and energy firms were beginning to question whether they want to be tied to \u201cincreasingly hostile US LNG\u201d.\nThe previously close relationship between Europe and the US is in crisis, since newly installed president Donald Trump this month began negotiations with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine \u2013 without EU or Ukrainian involvement \u2013 while sniping at both Europe and Nato.\nIncoming German chancellor Friedrich Merz warned this week that intervention from Washington was \u201cno less drastic, dramatic and ultimately no less brazen\u201d than the intervention Europe had experienced from Moscow.\nSwitched sides\u201cThe US has essentially switched sides, so Europe has not just lost an ally, but gained a [threat],\u201d Gloystein said, noting that this had \u201cshaken\u201d Europe\u2019s energy executives and political leaders.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t rely on US LNG if there is a potential for export tariffs being imposed. The marginal price for US LNG is already quite expensive. Now there are also reliability issues,\u201d he said.\nThe US was last year the largest supplier of LNG to the EU-27 countries, shipping 36.2m tonnes (49.2bcm) transatlantic, out of a combined total of 82.5m tonnes imported from all origins, according to Kpler vessel-tracking data.\nNominal US LNG export capacity is set to expand by\u00a038% from 2025 levels to 21.2bn cubic feet per day (600mcm\/day) by 2028, according to latest Energy Information Administration estimates. Much of this output had, until now, been expected to head to Europe, amid efforts to further reduce the continent\u2019s\u00a0reliance on Russian gas.\nIf it is to avoid increasing\u00a0reliance on US LNG, Europe would need to seek alternative suppliers or cut its\u00a0gas usage, analysts said.\n\u201cNorway could extend peak gas production by 5-10 years, but Europe also needs to reduce its gas consumption,\u201d Gloystein said.\n\u201cIt won\u2019t affect existing deals, but the Europeans will now be reluctant to sign any new long-term LNG deals with the US,\u201d he said.\nNot a bright futureKatja Yafimava,\u00a0a senior research fellow with the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, said there was unlikely to be a near-term impact on US flows, but that there could be a hastening of efforts to ditch gas as a baseload fuel.\n\u201cWhile the EU, as a whole, will likely increase imports of US LNG, as the new \u201cwave\u201d is coming \u2013 not least\u00a0to try to placate Trump and fight off the threat of US tariffs \u2013 it will double down on its decarbonisation policy, leading to progressive reduction of gas demand in the future,\u201d said Yafimava.\n\u201cOverall, this would spell not too bright a future for natural gas in Europe \u2013 neither Russian, nor \u2013 as time goes by \u2013 American,\u201d she added.\n",
