        "subtitle":"\n              (Montel) European gas prices jumped 5% early on Wednesday following news that Russia would temporarily suspend attacks on energy infrastructure but failed to agree to an unconditional ceasefire.\n            ",
        "body":"\nThe benchmark front-month TTF gas contract was seen last up EUR 1.91 at EUR 42.67\/MWh on Ice Endex. Earlier, it hit a four-session high of EUR 42.89\/MWh.\nRussian president Vladimir Putin late on Tuesday agreed to suspend attacks on Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure for a month during a call with his US counterpart Donald Trump, Montel reported.\n\u201cIt seems the lack of a ceasefire was disappointing,\u201d said a cross-commodities analyst with a UK investment firm.\n\u201cIt was to be expected,\u201d said a Ukraine-based energy trader.\nAn analyst with a German energy firm also said the market was reacting to news from the talks, although he had expected a more bearish response from Russia\u2019s pledge to halt attacks on energy infrastructure. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not exactly what I was expecting as a price reaction,\u201d he said.\nAdding further support to the market, an unplanned outage at the Asgard field will cut Norwegian gas flows by 5.1mcm\/day until Thursday morning, according to TSO Gassco.\n\n\n",
