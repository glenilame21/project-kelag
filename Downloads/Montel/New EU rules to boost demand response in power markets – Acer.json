        "subtitle":"\n              (Montel) New EU technical rules are set to make it easier to integrate demand-side response into wholesale electricity markets, the bloc's energy regulatory agency Acer said on Tuesday.\n            ",
        "body":"\nAcer\u2019s proposed\u00a0EU demand response network code would enable end users, storage providers and\u00a0generators connected to distribution grids\u00a0to take part fully in wholesale electricity markets, providing \u201cmuch-needed flexibility\u201d in a system\u00a0that is\u00a0shifting to more variable\u00a0renewables generation, it said.\nThe code would\u00a0create a European registry to standardise how demand response is measured and\u00a0simplify prequalification for providing demand response services to system operators, among other measures intended to improve power supply security and enhance market liquidity.\nThe goal was to create conditions that enabled retail and industrial\u00a0end\u00a0users to respond to changes in wholesale electricity market prices or to financial incentives to increase, reduce\u00a0or shift their demand to a different time, Acer said.\nThis could be used to help balance supply and demand or reduce grid congestion, it said.\nNext stepsAcer has sent its proposed code to the European Commission for approval, along with recommendations to update related EU technical rules on electricity balancing, system operations and demand connection.\nIts version builds on the draft submitted by the EU\u2019s formal distribution system operators\u2019 body E.DSO and transmission system operators\u2019 body Entso-E in May.\nAcer will hold a public webinar on 27 March to present its proposal and recommendations.\nThe final rules must be approved by the EC and a committee of EU national government experts to become binding.\n",
