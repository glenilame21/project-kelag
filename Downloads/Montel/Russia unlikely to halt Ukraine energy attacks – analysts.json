        "subtitle":"\n              (Montel) Russia is unlikely to keep its promise to stop attacks on Ukrainian power and gas systems as it retains an advantage, energy analysts told Montel on Wednesday.\n            ",
        "body":"\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine it would give up on destroying Ukraine power and gas sectors, which are vital for the country\u2019s war effort,\u201d said Maciej Zaniewicz, senior program manager with Warsaw-based Forum Energii think tank.\nRussian president Vladimir Putin late on Tuesday agreed to suspend attacks on Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure for a month.\nHowever, Ukrainian media reported that Russian attacks late yesterday left half of the eastern Ukrainian city of Slovyansk without power, while Ukraine reportedly hit oil tanks in the Russian southern city of Kazanskaya.\n\u201cThe Russian Federation\u2019s reliability in upholding temporary agreements, without robust guarantees, remains questionable,\u201d said Tsvetomir Nikolov, energy policy analyst with the Sofia-based Center for the Study of Democracy.\nRussia would likely double cyberattacks on Ukrainian energy sector as these would be less risky than missile strikes even if it signed a peace treaty, said Kamil Lipinski, head of the Polish Economic Institute\u2019s energy team.\nMeanwhile, Henning Gloystein, director of energy, climate, and resources at the consultancy Eurasia Group said: \u201cSo far, even the cessation of air strikes on energy infrastructure isn\u2019t even. Still, Eurasia Group expects a truce to happen, probably by early May as Moscow will try to gain as much territory as possible.\u201d\nRepairsHowever, a medium-term ceasefire would be necessary to repair damage, said Zaniewicz, with the country\u2019s gas storage units hitting a fresh record low earlier this week.\n\u201cThe timeframe for such repairs remains uncertain due to the complexity of assessing the extent of damage,\u201d said Nikolov.\n\u201cUkraine\u2019s power system is in much better shape now than a year ago, with long-time blackouts happening rarely,\u201d said Zaniewicz.\nHowever, he said Russia could destroy what Ukraine rebuilds during any potential ceasefire in 1-2 days of airstrikes.\n",
