        "body":"\n\u201cIf European steel disappears, so too does European automotive, European security and defence, energy infrastructure, transportation and others,\u201d Eurofer president Henrik Adam said in response to the US\u2019s\u00a0decision to impose tariffs of up to 25% on steel and aluminium imports from today.\nEurope\u2019s control over its supply chains in these strategic\u00a0sectors was at risk, Adam said.\u00a0\nSteel production is energy intensive,\u00a0and energy companies rely on steel to help generate and transport their products, from wind turbines to oil and gas pipelines.\u00a0\nSaturated marketUS blanket protection measures combined with record global excess capacity levels risked the \u201calready saturated\u201d EU market being flooded with cheap steel originally intended for the US market, undercutting local production, Adam said.\n\u201cOur producers already face the highest energy prices while having the highest climate ambition,\u201d\u00a0he added.\nThe European Commission has\u00a0said that\u00a0the EU steel sector\u00a0needs\u00a0help to cope with the challenges of decarbonising while boosting its global competitiveness and keeping production in Europe.\nIt plans to unveil an EU action plan for steel and metals next Wednesday that will address how to make low-carbon steel production commercially viable, among other issues.\nEuropean responseMeanwhile, the EC responded to the US tariffs by warning it would impose EU tariffs on a range of US products from 1 April, including boats, bourbon and motorbikes.\nIt will expand the list by mid-April, after consulting on which further products to include.\nThe EC remained open to a negotiated solution, however, as \u201cit is not in our common interest to burden our economies with tariffs,\u201d said\u00a0its\u00a0president Ursula von der Leyen.\nShe has asked EU trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic to resume talks with his US counterparts to explore the options.\nSefcovic, who helped Russia and Ukraine\u00a0negotiate\u00a0their last five-year agreement on gas transit to the EU\u00a0in 2019,\u00a0said there was common ground with the US.\n\u201cIn relation to steel and aluminium, we share some of the challenges \u2013 for instance, on global overcapacities driven by non-market practices \u2013 and the EU is therefore part of the solution, rather than a problem,\u201d he said.\u00a0\n",
