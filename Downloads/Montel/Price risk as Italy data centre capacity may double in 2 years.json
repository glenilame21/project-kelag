        "subtitle":"\n              (Montel) Italy\u2019s data centre industry is set to almost double installed capacity in the next two years, the Italian Data Center Association (IDA) said late on Tuesday, which an analyst warned could raise the country\u2019s power prices even further.\n            ",
        "body":"\nBy the end of 2026, capacity should increase to about 913 MW from 513 MW at the end of 2024, said the lobby group that\u00a0represents data centre builders and operators, while in 2025,\u00a0capacity should grow about 37% to 701 MW.\n\u201cWe have a clear growth path in the coming years,\u201d said Floriano Monteduro, who heads IDA\u2019s energy access and technical committee, during the Key Choice PPA event in Rimini on\u00a0the Adriatic\u00a0coast.\nData centres were expanding in Italy to keep up with cloud computing, artificial intelligence, connectivity and digitisation growth, said Davide Macor, vice-president of IDA\u2019s energy access and technical committee.\nIn addition, Italy\u2019s potential as a data centre market was attracting investment due to its\u00a0strategic geographical\u00a0position in terms of power interconnectivity, he added.\u00a0\nIn a slower growth scenario, Italy\u2019s data centres would see installed capacity grow to 766 MW\u00a0by the end of\u00a02026, up from 638\u00a0MW by the end of\u00a0this year, Macor said, citing data compiled by the Milan Polytechnic\u00a0university\u2019s\u00a0Data Centre Observatory.\nPower price pressureHowever, this growth could increase the country\u2019s electricity prices, affecting competitiveness at a time it suffers some of the highest power prices in Europe,\u00a0said Francesco Sassi, a research fellow at think tank RIE.\n\u201cAdditional power demand in the premium EU power market would add some upward pressure on prices, which cannot help the competitiveness of the country\u2019s economy or bolster EU electricity interconnections,\u201d Sassi told Montel.\nRisk factors\nInvestors must consider risk factors such as regulatory frameworks, permit requirements and the status of TSO connections and power supply,\u00a0Macor said. In Italy, there are currently 30 GW of data centre requests for TSO connectivity, said the IDA.\n\u201cData centres\u00a0need\u00a0to be built near networks and there must be sufficient capacity,\" Macor said,\u00a0adding that the cost\u00a0of power and sustainability were Italy\u2019s issues rather than energy availability.\nSassi called for grid upgrades, increased flexibility and\u00a0renewables buildout to support the data centre capacity increase.\nElectricity consumption by Italy\u2019s data centres is set to more than double to 1.4 GW by 2028 from 2024, experts warned\u00a0late last year.\n",
