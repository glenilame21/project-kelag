        "body":"\nOn\u00a0Wednesday,\u00a0Bulgarian nuclear power producer Kozloduy sold 250 MW of power at EUR 74.85\/MWh on Ibex for delivery this weekend. More than 30 local and foreign firms took part in the tender.\nDue to the high demand, Kozloduy would be selling another 150 MW\u00a0of the same product tomorrow, power exchange Ibex said in a statement.\nLocal traders pointed out Bulgaria\u2019s power consumption had fallen sharply\u00a0due to warmer temperatures, particularly over the weekend.\n\u201cAs a result, Kozloduy\u2019s share of the regulated market during weekends is decreasing and there is an energy surplus, which the plant will try to sell on Ibex,\u201d\u00a0a\u00a0trader noted.\nA growing trendTraders expected to see increased weekend futures selling as the region built more solar capacity.\n\u201cThis is a growing trend across the region when you have forecasts for warm weather and high solar production for the weekend,\u201d a second trader said.\n\u201cGrid operators need to balance the grid and nuclear plants like Kozloduy, which can\u2019t stop running. But [with] expected low demand from the regulated household market, [they] need to sell the excess energy on the wholesale market,\u201d he added.\nA Hungarian trader attributed the trend to plants looking to avoid zero or negative power prices.\n\u201cThis will happen more and more often as [a combination of] warm weather, high solar, low consumption and excess energy in general leads to negative prices and imbalances,\u201d he said.\nHungary, Romania and Bulgaria are seeking to install at least 20 GW in combined solar capacity by 2030. This means nuclear plants such as Hungary\u2019s Paks, Romania\u2019s Cernavoda and Kozloduy need to design an output trading strategy for profit optimisation, traders agreed.\n",
