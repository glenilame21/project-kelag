        "subtitle":"\n              (Montel) Norwegian energy minister Terje Aasland on Tuesday dismissed criticism from neighbouring countries that introducing a fixed retail electricity price would distort the Nordic power market.\n            ",
        "body":"\n\u201cI believe [the fixed price] will not significantly disrupt the market. We have a very large consumption that lies outside what will be covered by it,\u201d Aasland told Montel on the sidelines of the Sparebank 1 Markets energy conference in Oslo.\nThe government\u2019s proposal for a voluntary fixed one-year price of NOK 400\/MWh (EUR 34\/MWh) for all households from 1 October \u2013 named Norgespris \u2013 has come under fire because it could fail to deter electricity consumption during hours with high demand.\nFinland\u2019s energy minister recently said Norway\u2019s plan could distort the Nordic power market, while Sweden\u2019s energy authority has said it may inflate prices there and also undermine liquidity in the futures market.\nDenmark\u2019s energy lobby, Green Power Denmark, said the proposal represents a form of populism in energy policy that undermine market forces.\nHowever, Aasland said the measure \u201ccreates predictability and stability\u201d without having to intervene in the wholesale market.\n\u201cI believe it is a very good solution and a further development of the electricity support scheme,\u201d he said, referring to the reimbursement to households for 90% of spot prices rising above NOK 750\/MWh.\nAasland said the criticism from other Nordic countries did not affect him.\n\u201cWhen the Swedes mostly have fixed [retail] prices, or there are hybrid solutions for fixed price schemes in Finland, that is also a similar approach. We are now creating a scheme in Norway that secures households. That is the government\u2019s goal, and I think we have come up with a very good solution,\u201d he said.\nEUR 1 = NOK 11.65\n",
