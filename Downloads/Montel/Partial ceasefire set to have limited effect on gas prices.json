        "subtitle":"\n              (Montel) Russia\u2019s agreement to halt attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure for 30 days was not enough to have a significant bearish impact on European gas markets, analysts told Montel on Wednesday.\n            ",
        "body":"\nRussian president Vladimir Putin agreed to immediately suspend attacks on Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure late on Tuesday, following talks with his US counterpart Donald Trump.\nSince the announcement, attacks on civilian Ukrainian infrastructure \u2013 including an energy substation in the Donetsk region \u2013 have been reported, and Russian authorities have said a Ukrainian drone attack damaged an oil depot in the country\u2019s Krasnodar region.\n\u201cThe fact that we are not seeing a proper ceasefire is tending to push prices slightly higher,\u201d said Mike Fulwood, senior research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, although he noted that \u201cTTF prices always go up first thing in the morning then reverse\u201d.\nThe benchmark front-month TTF gas contract was last seen trading up by EUR 2.48 at EUR 43.24\/MWh.\nMost analysts contacted by Montel said the price movement was not necessarily linked to the geopolitical situation, although one gas market expert said the increase was due to \u201cdisappointment\u201d at the outcome of the Trump-Putin call.\n\u201cOne would hope for more than a temporary energy ceasefire,\u201d said Klaas Dozeman, analyst at Brainchild Commodity Intelligence.\nNo significant changes\u201cA 30-day ceasefire is good, it might open up discussions and help to assess the direction in which [the conflict] is heading, but it won\u2019t lead to significant changes\u201d on gas markets, said Anne-Sophie Corbeau, a Columbia University research scholar.\nThe timeframe and limited scope of the ceasefire was too short for any substantial impact on gas volumes, she said, although it could \u201cease some of the nervousness in the market\u201d.\nAn enduring ceasefire could possibly lead to the lifting of US sanctions, including on Russia\u2019s newly built Arctic LNG 2 facility, which would have a bearish impact on European gas prices, said Fulwood, although \u201cit would take months to get [the facility] up and running\u201d.\n\u201cThere is not enough gas coming to Europe, markets are tight. If we suddenly see sanctions on Arctic LNG 2 being lifted or significantly reduced, we would have an extra 9 bcm on the market,\u201d Corbeau said, adding that \u201cmarkets would definitely react\u201d in a bearish way to such a development.\nToo naive?However, the gas market expert described expectations of a return of Russian gas flows to Europe as \u201cnaive\u201d. Resuming transit flows through Ukraine would be \u201cquite difficult to sell in terms of internal politics\u201d, he said, while the use of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline would hit regulatory and legal hurdles.\n\u201cUltimately the question is whether European buyers would like to buy Russian gas, and I think in most countries there is limited appetite for that,\u201d he said, adding that gas markets would likely ease in 2026-27 with the arrival of new LNG capacity.\n\u201cI cannot yet see the transit of Russian gas [resuming] via Ukraine in the foreseeable future,\u201d said Marina Tsygankova, director of global gas and LNG at LSEG.\nUkrainian productionA halt in bombings of Ukrainian energy infrastructure could also lead the country to require less gas imports from Europe, Tsygankova said.\nThe gas market expert previously cited said Ukraine was likely to need more gas imports from the EU to refill its storage units this summer, due to damage sustained by its gas production units that would take time to repair.\nCurrently, the main gas flows to Ukraine are from Slovakia, Hungary and \u2013 to a lesser extent \u2013 Poland, he said.\nUkrainian gas storage was last seen at just 3.7% full, according to Gas Infrastructure Europe.\n",
