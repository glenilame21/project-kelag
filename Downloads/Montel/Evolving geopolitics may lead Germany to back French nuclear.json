        "subtitle":"\n              (Montel) Germany\u2019s evolving stance on atomic energy combined with a US-induced geopolitical shift is likely to pave the way for greater EU support for France\u2019s nuclear power ambitions, analysts told Montel.\n            ",
        "body":"\n\u201cThe change in the geopolitical situation and Germany\u2019s election are consolidating the Franco-German relationship, which had taken a bit of a beating,\u201d said Olga Givernet, an MP with French president Emmanuel Macron\u2019s centrist Renaissance party and former energy minister.\nShe was referring to the pro-nuclear stance of Germany\u2019s likely future chancellor, Friedrich Merz, after last month\u2019s election, as well as Europe\u2019s new focus on defence amid US president Donald Trump\u2019s chaotic return to power.\u00a0\n\u201cWe hope to converge more on energy policies and see more flexibility regarding nuclear power,\u201d she added, regarding Germany\u2019s long-standing opposition to nuclear.\nFrance would try to capitalise on the geopolitical shift to intensify its nuclear diplomacy in Europe, which it has pursued in the Nuclear Alliance, a coalition of 14 pro-nuclear EU countries, said Yves Marignac, spokesman for think tank NegaWatt.\nGermany softens\u00a0The country has long pushed for nuclear power to be recognised alongside renewables in EU climate objectives and for it to be eligible for similar subsidies. But these demands have met strong opposition from Germany, which closed its last reactors in 2023,\u00a0and others in Europe, including Luxembourg, Austria and Ireland.\nThe new German government would \u201clikely take a much more neutral stance on French nuclear than the last one,\u201d said Christoph Maurer, managing director of German consulting firm Consentec.\u00a0\n\u201cThey might even agree on some kind of technology-neutral EU funding mechanism for decarbonised energy, which could cover nuclear.\u201d\nGerman fears that Trump might \u201cweaponise\u201d US LNG exports as part of his trade war could weaken resistance to nuclear power, Maurer said. \u201cRelying on a European energy source might be seen more favourably than it was even just a few weeks ago.\u201d\nGermany\u2019s stance on nuclear power had already softened since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, Maurer said. Before the war, it relied on Russia for 55% of its gas imports.\nA key shift occurred in 2022 when Germany accepted nuclear being classified as a \u201cgreen\u201d investment under certain conditions in the EU\u2019s taxonomy framework.\nContentious fundingMore recently, the EU has\u00a0included\u00a0nuclear in its state aid framework. While the proposed rules prioritise green hydrogen over low-carbon hydrogen for subsidies, nuclear \u2013 initially absent from the draft \u2013 was added to the final version.\u00a0\nHowever, nuclear funding remained contentious, with the European Investment Bank (EIB) still prioritising renewables over nuclear in its climate strategy, said Teva Meyer, lecturer in geopolitics at France\u2019s University of Haute-Alsace.\nA Franco-German reconciliation on nuclear energy depended on the country\u2019s ongoing coalition negotiations to form a government, Meyer said, while Luxembourg and Austria could block pro-nuclear decisions if unanimity was required.\n",
