        "subtitle":"\n              (Montel) The European Commission wants to delay companies\u2019 certificate purchasing obligation under the EU carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) from 2026 to 2027, according to a leaked draft document seen by Montel.\n            ",
        "body":"\nCompanies should\u00a0\u201conly be obliged\u201d to purchase CBAM certificates in 2027 for\u00a0emissions from\u00a0goods imported in 2026, according to the proposal,\u00a0to give them sufficient time to adapt.\n\u201cCompanies will still be on the hook for 2026 emissions but won\u2019t need to fully account for them until 2027,\u201d Dan Maleski, senior environmental markets advisor at Redshaw Advisors, told Montel.\nThe\u00a02027\u00a0price of CBAM certificates\u00a0to cover emissions from\u00a0goods imported into the EU in 2026 should reflect the price of EU ETS allowances in 2026, according to the draft document.\u00a0The current EUA benchmark, the Dec 25, was last seen trading at\u00a0EUR 72.48\/t.\nCBAM, set\u00a0to launch in 2026, covers imports of electricity, iron and steel, aluminium, hydrogen, fertilisers and cement.\nEUA price impact?\u201cThis delay doesn\u2019t remove the financial burden, it just shifts when it hits,\u201d\u00a0said Maleski.\u00a0\u201cFor this reason, we don\u2019t expect any short-term EUA price impact\u2026 because liability doesn\u2019t go away and anyone pre-hedging has no reason to change their approach.\u201d\nSimon Goess, managing director at German consultancy Carboneer, said it would be interesting to see if the proposed delay affected the phase-out of free allowances in the EU ETS, currently set to end by 2034.\nHe said EU producers could be disadvantaged if there was \u201ca delay of the obligation to purchase CBAM certificates from 2026 to 2027\u201d without \u201can equivalent change in the EU ETS regulation\u201d.\nThe\u00a0EC\u00a0has been looking at ways to simplify CBAM, including suggestions earlier this month of\u00a0exempting\u00a080% of eligible EU companies by raising the threshold for inclusion.\nThe latest draft document has proposed new exemption thresholds for small importers, including a threshold of 50 tonnes of covered goods and 100 tonnes of embedded carbon dioxide, which are expected to exempt around 90% of importers from obligations.\nOther\u00a0new\u00a0proposals include the introduction of tougher penalties for deliberate non-compliance and a reduction in quarterly certificate holding requirements.\n",
