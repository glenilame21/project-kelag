        "body":"\nThe government planned to save EUR 246m between 2025-2029 by cutting funding initially earmarked for the development of hydrogen transport infrastructure, Belgian daily L\u2019Echo reported.\nThe move effectively eliminated most of the funding allocated by the previous government, although the first phase of the project would still receive EUR 95m from the EU recovery plan.\n\u201c[Hydrogen] backbone projects are facing delays across Europe as green hydrogen remains significantly more expensive than fossil fuels,\u201d Bihet said during a parliamentary hearing.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no point in rolling over budgets year after year due to a lack of demand \u2013 or worse, building pipelines that remain empty. That would be a real failure,\u201d the minister said.\nHowever, the government would reassess the sector\u2019s needs \u201cbased on industrial conditions and the progress of private hydrogen projects,\u201d Bihet said. A meeting with Fluxys, Belgium\u2019s hydrogen network operator, was planned in the coming weeks.\n\u201cIf demand materialises in the medium term, we will explore ways to finance the infrastructure efficiently,\u201d Bihet added.\n",
