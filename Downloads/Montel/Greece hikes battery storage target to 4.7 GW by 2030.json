        "subtitle":"\n              (Montel) Greece aims to offer grid connections for 4.7 GW of battery energy storage system capacity by 2030, 1.2 GW more than earlier planned, in a move aimed at helping balance the grid and reduce curtailments. \u00a0\n            ",
        "body":"\nThe latest target, which was published in a decree in Greece\u2019s Official Gazette last week, is significantly above the 3.5 GW one shared just last month. \n\u201cThis is not a jump, it\u2019s a jump to the moon,\u201d Efstathios Sideris, the country manager of renewables developer Ecoenergy Greece, said in a LinkedIn post over the weekend.\nThe capacity, to be offered via tenders, will not be linked to a government subsidies scheme.\nAccording to the decree, developers need to submit a collateral of EUR 200,000 per MW of installed capacity to be connected to the transmission grid, and EUR 50,000 per MW for the distribution grid.\nInvestors will have up to 18 months to submit their letter of intent.\nThe new \u00a0aim exceeds Greece\u2019s Nationale Energy and Climate Plan target, which envisages 4.3 GW of battery energy storage capacity by 2030.\u00a0\nRising curtailmentsThe additional BESS capacity should help balance the grid and reduce curtailments in instances of renewables oversupply\u00a0to under 5% by 2030, \u00a0according to Sotiris Kapellos, \u00a0chairman of the Hellenic Association of Photovoltaic Companies (Helapco).\nIn 2024,\u00a0the volume of curtailed renewables more than doubled on the year to nearly 900 GWh, accounting for 3.5% of the country\u2019s total renewable generation, according to data from local DSO Hedno.\nKapellos said that so far this month, Greece has seen a 20% of green curtailments, mostly solar, up from 12% over the same period a year ago.\n",
