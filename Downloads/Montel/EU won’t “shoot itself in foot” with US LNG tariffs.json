        "subtitle":"\n              (Montel) The EU was likely to avoid imposing tariffs on US LNG in retaliation for president Donald Trump\u2019s looming trade war, as the chilled fuel remained crucial for the bloc, analysts told Montel\u2019s bi-monthly Spanish podcast.\n            ",
        "body":"\nAny response involving EU tariffs on US LNG \u201cwould be like shooting itself in the foot\u201d, Paula Di Mattia, analyst for European gas at Icis, told Energia al Dia, with her comments coming amid Washington\u2019s threat of tariffs to bridge an estimated USD 236bn trade deficit with the bloc.\n\u201cThat [EU retaliation] is not going to happen, especially given Europe\u2019s position, which is so dependent on LNG and especially on American LNG,\u201d she added, with Trump calling on the EU to take even more US LNG to tackle its deficit.\nBefore the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Europe relied on Russian gas to cover around 40% of its demand but it has been diversifying its supply and has become heavily reliant on the likes of US LNG.\nIndustry strugglesIgnacio Urbasos, a researcher at Spain\u2019s think tank Elcano, also ruled out potential tariffs on US LNG, telling the podcast that industry was already struggling with high energy prices.\nEurope could see, in turn, an increase in imports to \u201cappease\u201d the new Trump administration.\nHowever, energy cooperation between the US and the EU to phase out Russian energy seemed to have foundered with the end of president Joe Biden\u2019s term, he added.\n\u201cFor many European capitals, what was once a secure supply has changed its profile and now shows greater [geopolitical] risks.\u201d\nCountries could seek alternative LNG sources, such as Qatar, which still had a \u201clarge part\u201d of its new production capacity uncontracted, with it due to come online later this decade, Urbasos said.\n\u201cDelicate situation\u201dYet, it all came against the backdrop of a \u201cdelicate\u201d supply situation in Europe, with storage levels just above 40%, said Icis\u2019s Di Mattia.\nIt also meant Europe \u201cis not in a position to sanction Russian LNG\u201d, as its energy security was currently \u201cinsufficient\u201d, she added, in reference to ongoing talks to extend sanctions to the chilled fuel amid the Ukraine war.\n",
