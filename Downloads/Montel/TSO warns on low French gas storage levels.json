        "subtitle":"\n              (Montel) French gas storage levels were currently among the lowest in the EU at 22%, well below the region\u2019s 38% average, the country\u2019s gas TSO said on Tuesday, adding it was time to start refilling underground storage.\n            ",
        "body":"\nAt the same time last year, French gas storage was at 43%, according to data from Gas Infrastructure Europe.\nThe TSO partly attributed the relatively low storage level to a rise in French gas exports to neighbouring countries, including to Belgium, Italy and Switzerland, with these exports jumping\u00a010% year on year to 123 TWh.\nGas suppliers had also made \u201csignificant\u201d withdrawals starting in early November 2024, \u201cprimarily driven by economic arbitrage opportunities\u201d, said Sandrine Meunier, CEO of Natran, formerly known as GRTgaz.\nTime for a refill\u201cThe [filling] process should be started as soon as possible,\u201d Meunier said.\nNonetheless, the market and suppliers appeared confident about storage filling for 2025, she added.\n\u201cPrices are currently not favourable for storage filling. However, prices on the futures market are stable for this summer and will likely continue to stabilise or decrease thereafter,\u201d she told reporters at the firm\u2019s 2024 overview press conference.\nThe TTF contract for Summer 2025 was last seen trading EUR 1.43 above the Winter contract, at EUR 43.13\/MWh.\nEC plansGenerally, the storage filling or injection season runs from April through October, although\u00a0the \u201cpractical start\u201d depended on weather conditions, said Pierre Cotin, a TSO director.\u201cEven if [storage] levels drop to the lower end of the 2018-2023 average, we still have sufficient infrastructure to achieve 90% storage fill by the\u00a0[1 November] target date,\u201d he said, adding that it was \u201cup to the suppliers to take action\u201d.\nRegarding the European Commission\u2019s plan\u00a0to propose an extension of the bloc\u2019s gas storage regulation until the end of 2027, Cotin said the TSO was \u201cin favour of maintaining\u201d gas storage targets, although adjustments to the required level or target date could be \u201cconsidered\u201d.\nDemandLast year, French gas demand dropped around 6% year on year to 361 TWh, in line with data from regional TSO Terega\u00a0published last month.\nIndustrial gas demand was up 0.8% to 109 TWh, while residential and commercial use fell 0.6% to 235 TWh .\nThe downward trend in gas use would continue this year as energy-saving and efficiency measures had \u201cbecome engrained in consumption habits\u201d, Meunier said.\nIndustrial demand would likely follow a similar trajectory to last year, she added.\n",
