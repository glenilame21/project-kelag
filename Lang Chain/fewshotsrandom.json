        "subtitle":"New IEA report shows tripling renewables and doubling energy efficiency are feasible with the right enabling conditions, offering North Star for national policies and international cooperation",
        "body":"Full implementation of the landmark energy goals established at the COP28 climate conference in Dubai last year would drive down greenhouse gas emissions and significantly accelerate the transformation of the global energy sector, according to a new IEA report that can serve as a guidebook for turning countries\u2019 collective pledges into action.At COP28, nearly 200\u00a0countries agreed to work towards an ambitious set of global energy objectives as part of the outcome known as the UAE Consensus \u2013 pledging to achieve net zero emissions from the global energy sector by 2050, transition away from fossil fuels, triple renewable energy capacity and double the rate of energy efficiency improvements by 2030, and accelerate the deployment of other low-emissions technologies. The new IEA report, From Taking Stock to Taking Action: How to implement the COP28 energy goals, is the first comprehensive global analysis of what putting the targets into practice would achieve \u2013 and how it can be done.The report highlights the feasibility of achieving the tripling and doubling goals, in particular \u2013 though it stresses that this will hinge on additional international efforts to set the right enabling conditions, as well as on countries using the UAE Consensus as the compass for their next round of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement.\u201cThe goals set by nearly 200\u00a0countries at COP28 can be transformative for the global energy sector, putting it on a fast track towards a more secure, affordable and sustainable future. To ensure the world doesn\u2019t miss this huge opportunity, the focus must shift rapidly to implementation,\u201d said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol. \u201cAs this new IEA report shows, the COP28 energy goals should lay the foundation for countries\u2019 new climate targets under the Paris Agreement \u2013 they are the North Star for what the energy sector needs to do. And further international cooperation is vital to deliver fit-for-purpose grids, sufficient energy storage and faster electrification, which are integral to move clean energy transitions quickly and securely.\u201dAccording to the report, the goal of tripling global renewable energy capacity by 2030 is within reach thanks to favourable economics, ample manufacturing potential and strong policies. But greater capacity does not automatically mean that more renewable electricity will clean up the world\u2019s power systems, lower costs for consumers and slash fossil fuel use.To unlock the full benefits of the tripling goal, countries need to make a concerted push to build and modernise 25\u00a0million\u00a0kilometres of electricity grids by 2030, according to the report. The world would also need 1\u00a0500\u00a0gigawatts (GW) of energy storage capacity by 2030, of which 1\u00a0200\u00a0GW needs to come from battery storage, a 15-fold increase on today\u2019s level.The report emphasises the need for a more granular, country-specific approach to achieving the critical goal of doubling energy efficiency by 2030. Doing so would potentially cut global energy costs by almost 10%, reduce emissions by 6.5\u00a0billion\u00a0tonnes, and strengthen countries\u2019 energy security.Yet getting there requires that governments around the world make energy efficiency a much greater policy priority and focus relentlessly on key actions. For advanced economies, this means homing in on electrification, given that doubling efficiency requires pushing electricity\u2019s share of global energy consumption towards 30% by 2030. The report notes that electric vehicles and heat pumps are significantly more efficient than their traditional alternatives. Meanwhile, for emerging economies, stronger efficiency standards \u2013 particularly for cooling equipment such as air conditioners \u2013 are vital for faster progress. And for countries without full access to modern forms of energy, achieving the Sustainable Development Goal of universal access to clean cooking supplies significantly reduces energy demand, transforms lives and livelihoods, and prevents millions of early deaths.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The report finds that fully achieving the COP28 goals for renewables and efficiency would cut global emissions by 10\u00a0billion\u00a0tonnes by 2030 compared with what is otherwise expected, helping to give the world a fighting chance of meeting the Paris Agreement\u2019s temperature goals. It also sets out key energy sector benchmarks for countries to consider as they design supportive new NDCs, which are due in 2025.The report was released during the United Nations General Assembly in New York, which coincides with Climate Week NYC. Over the course of the week, leaders from across government, industry and civil society are gathering to discuss opportunities for greater action on energy, climate and sustainable development issues. Alongside these events, the IEA is hosting the third in its current series of High-Level Energy Transition Dialogues in collaboration with the COP29 Presidency. The dialogue with global decision makers in New York City will focus on the findings of this report and next steps.In addition to the release of the COP28 report, the IEA also updated its Climate Pledges Explorer. The interactive online tool provides granular information on medium- and long-term climate plans for more than 190 countries, including estimates for implied emissions reductions within the energy sector. It also features a list of all net zero pledges globally, including their legal status and target year.",

Angesichts der schwachen Wirtschaftsdaten blicken die spekulativen Marktteilnehmer derweil jedoch weiter pessimistisch auf den europ\u00c3\u00a4ischen Emissionshandel und haben ihre Netto-Short-Positionen auf 26,2 Mio. EUAs erh\u00c3\u00b6ht, das h\u00c3\u00b6chste Niveau seit Mitte M\u00c3\u00a4rz. Dies entspricht einem Anstieg der Netto-Short-Position von 6,9 Mio. EUAs im Vergleich zur Vorwoche. Die Short-Positionen der spekulativen H\u00c3\u00a4ndler stiegen um 3,2 Mio. EUAs auf 66,5 Mio. EUAs, w\u00c3\u00a4hrend die Long-Positionen um 3,7 Mio. auf 40,3 Mio. EUAs abgebaut wurden. Dies ging einher mit einem Wochenverlust des Dez. 24-Futures von 7,5 Prozent in der KW 40.UBA untersucht Krisenfestigkeit des EU-ETSIn einem Rechtsgutachten hat das Umweltbundesamt (UBA) die Krisenfestigkeit des europ\u00c3\u00a4ischen Emissionshandels (EU-ETS) untersucht. Aktuelle Krisen wie der Krieg in der Ukraine und die Corona-Pandemie stellen das EU-ETS vor erhebliche Herausforderungen, besonders bei der Umsetzung der Verpflichtung zur Abgabe von Emissionszertifikaten. Eine Untersuchung der aktuellen Gesetzeslage auf EU- und nationaler Ebene zeigt einen deutlichen Bedarf an Anpassungen, insbesondere im Umgang mit Krisensituationen wie h\u00c3\u00b6herer Gewalt, Insolvenzen oder Betriebsstilllegungen. Verbesserungen sollten sich auf klarere Regelungen und das Schlie\u00c3?en von L\u00c3\u00bccken konzentrieren, wobei die Zusammenarbeit zwischen EU- und nationalen Beh\u00c3\u00b6rden zentral ist. Statt eines reinen Ma\u00c3?nahmenkatalogs wird der Einsatz von Verwaltungsinstrumenten, wie etwa die Sperrung von Zertifikatkonten, als sinnvoll erachtet. So soll den Beh\u00c3\u00b6rden mehr Spielraum gegeben werden, um die Abgabeverpflichtungen auch in Krisenzeiten sicherzustellen. Derzeit d\u00c3\u00bcrfen insolvenzgef\u00c3\u00a4hrdete Unternehmen ihre Zertifikate verkaufen, ohne zuvor ihre Emissionsverpflichtungen des Vorjahres zu erf\u00c3\u00bcllen. Dieses Vorgehen f\u00c3\u00bchrt zu einem \u00c3?berangebot an Zertifikaten, was die Preise belastet. Das UBA empfiehlt daher, nationalen Regierungen zu gestatten, Unternehmen daran zu hindern, Zertifikate zu verkaufen, bevor ihre Emissionen des Vorjahres gedeckt sind.Autor: Tobias Waniek von enerchase\u00c2\u00a0",

Angesichts der schwachen Konjunktur k\u00c3\u00b6nnte dies dazu f\u00c3\u00bchren, dass einige Unternehmen diese kostenlosen Zertifikate nutzen, um ihre Emissionen von 2023, die im September ausgeglichen werden m\u00c3\u00bcssen, zu decken, was die Nachfrage weiter reduziert, da weniger Zertifikate nachgekauft werden m\u00c3\u00bcssen. Die EU-Kommission hat einen Zwischenstand f\u00c3\u00bcr den Prozess der kostenlosen EUA-Zuteilungen in diesem Jahr vorgelegt (Datenstand 11. Juli). Demnach haben die Mitgliedstaaten 76 Prozent der vorgesehenen Zertifikate bereits zugeteilt. In Deutschland ist der Prozess nahezu abgeschlossen, die Zuteilungsrate liegt bereits bei 99 Prozent. Da der Prozess auf EU-Ebene noch weiterl\u00c3\u00a4uft, bleibt der Preisdruck f\u00c3\u00bcr die EUAs bestehen.Rekordwert bei der Stromerzeugung aus erneuerbaren EnergienWeniger CO2-Zertifikate wurden in diesem Jahr au\u00c3?erdem aus dem Stromsektor ben\u00c3\u00b6tigt, da die Stromerzeugung aus fossilen Brennstoffen im zweiten Quartal auf den niedrigsten Stand aller Zeiten gefallen ist, w\u00c3\u00a4hrend die Produktion aus erneuerbaren Energien stark zugenommen hat. Die Stromerzeugung aus fossilen Brennstoffen lag im zweiten Quartal bei 131,9 TWh, was den niedrigsten Wert aller Zeiten darstellt. Im Vergleich dazu ist die Solarenergie im zweiten Quartal auf 86,2 TWh angestiegen, was eine Steigerung um 15 Prozent zum Vorjahr bedeutet. Auch die Stromproduktion aus Windkraft hat um 9 Prozent auf 107,6 TWh zugenommen. Damit haben die erneuerbaren Energien im zweiten Quartal mit einem Anteil von 55,7 Prozent an der gesamten europ\u00c3\u00a4ischen Stromerzeugung einen Rekordwert markiert.Autor: Tobias Waniek",

        "title":"Coal fades to black as UK shines light on green future",
        "subtitle":"(Montel) On an autumn day in 2010, perched on the banks of the river Thames, beside a 17th century fort and a field of windswept horses, the Tilbury B power plant in Essex was burning coal just as it had since it first fired up in the late 1960s. But change was afoot.",
        "body":"Tilbury B\u2019s charismatic plant manager, Nigel Staves, saw a future in pellets. Wood pellets, a compressed form of woody biomass, would account for 100% of the burn \u201cin the future\u201d, he said, from just 10% at the time. Three years later the plant was shut down.\nCoal-fired power plants like Tilbury B helped drive the UK\u2019s industrialisation and local economies for decades. In 2010, their fate was already sealed in legislation. Two years earlier, the secretary of state for energy and climate change at the time, the Labour Party\u2019s Ed Miliband, announced that the Climate Change Act 2008 would mandate an 80% cut overall in six greenhouse gases by 2050.\nThe legislation came with legally binding carbon budgets, a way to ensure the nation\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, such as CO2, the main gas from burning coal, were curbed to specific levels in five-year periods. Coal accounted for 30% of the UK\u2019s electricity mix in 2010. By 2016, the share dropped below 10%. Since 2022, it\u2019s been less than 2%.\nThis week, the nation\u2019s last coal-fired station, the 2 GW Ratcliffe-on-Soar plant in Nottinghamshire, extinguished its furnaces for good. There is much to celebrate in this achievement, given global efforts to cut down on carbon emissions, widely blamed for causing global climatic changes. Currently, UK waters boast the world\u2019s second-largest fleet of offshore wind turbines, after China, in terms of installed nameplate capacity. Britain aims to decarbonise the power sector by 2035 and to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.\nBut there is no escaping the fact that the UK\u2019s history, from both an industrial and social viewpoint, has been intrinsically linked, well beyond any living memory, to coal. \u201cCoal closure in the UK is a tremendous milestone in decarbonisation, and should be recognised for that, but it is also a moment when people will leave the site and face great uncertainty about their futures,\u201d says Peter O\u2019Grady, Ratcliffe-on-Soar\u2019s plant manager.\nA career in coalBruce Heppenstall started his career in coal, rising up to become plant director at the UK\u2019s Drax power station, formerly the third-largest coal-fired plant in Europe but now running on biomass. The attraction, he said, was driven by \u201cthese huge plants\u2026producing power to millions of homes\u201d at low cost. \u201cCoal was the UK\u2019s choice because it was on hand. It powered the industrial revolution, making steam, and then cheap, affordable power.\u201d\nThe Drax power station is huge. Its 12 massive cooling tours are visible for miles, with each taller than the dome of St Paul\u2019s Cathedral. The power plant ultimately succeeded where Tilbury failed, in mapping out a life for itself beyond coal, by turning instead to wood pellets and some other biofuels. \u201cAs recently as the early 2000s it was clear that coal was becoming yesterday\u2019s technology. And I think Drax Group took a huge leap of faith in moving across to using sustainable biomass. But thank goodness they did, because otherwise Drax would have been added to the list of power stations that would have closed,\u201d says Heppenstall.\nInstead, Drax is this year celebrating half a century of generation at the plant. \u201cI hope that in some 50 years\u2019 time, somebody else is stood there celebrating a hundred years and these units are still taking carbon out of the atmosphere in a sustainable manner,\u201d he says.\nShuttering minesThe UK\u2019s coal industry has seen many changes and challenges over the past 100 years, not least the closure of mines which once fed the power plants, and an ensuing reliance on imported material, particularly since the late 1990s.\u00a0 Shortly before the First World War, in 1913, the country produced nearly 300m tonnes of coal and was even a significant exporter of the fuel. But output had dropped to 130m tonnes by 1980 and just over 30m tonnes at the turn of the century.\nWith the closure of the UK\u2019s last large surface mine, Ffos-y-Fran in Wales, at the end of November last year, there are no more large-scale surface mines left. Government data shows that production in the second quarter of this year fell to a new record quarterly low of just 19,000 tonnes.\nNigel Yaxley spent more than four decades working in the UK coal industry. Now retired, he looks back fondly on his career, and particularly the people he worked with over the years. \u201cI was born in Sheffield and my grandfather worked down the pit near Barnsley, so I grew up very much surrounded by coal and was probably more aware of that than any other industry,\u201d he says. \u201cI was lucky enough to go to Cambridge and have a good education, but I guess whilst a lot of my colleagues were going into law and those sorts of professions I was, probably because of my background and upbringing, quite attracted to coal.\u201d\nYaxley joined the National Coal Board in 1977, which ran the nationalist coal-mining industry, when there were approximately a quarter of a million people employed in coal mining in Britain. In the 1990s, as the number of mine workers fell to a little over 10,000, he worked for the country\u2019s largest coal mining firm, UK Coal, and in the 2000s became managing director of the Association of UK Coal Importers and Producers, witnessing miner numbers dwindle to below 1,000 by the early 2020s.\n\u201cA lot of the people I knew from the UK who were highly competent mining engineers moved to Australia or got involved in other international work of that type. There\u2019s never any shortage of international consultancy work for good mining engineers. On the generation side, it was easier to simply move to different fuels, so you had people who went across to gas or went into other fuel areas. And quite a lot of people hung on to the bitter end, because it was what they were familiar with. But now is the bitter end of course.\u201d\nTransitioning awayOne such trader who moved away from coal is Trevor Rhodes. Trading in the early 2010s for Engie\u2019s 1 GW Rugeley B power plant, in Staffordshire, Rhodes helped to source 2-3m tonnes\/year from Colombia and Russia to keep the plant running in its twilight years. \u201cI started in 2011 and had been expecting to buy for a station that would run at about half capacity. However, by 2013 it was pretty much running flat out,\u201d he says, noting a temporary drop in coal prices and stable carbon costs meant the plant was kept online longer than initially expected, for something of a last hurrah.\nHowever, it inevitably closed its doors for the last time in mid-2016, after around 46 years of service. Rhodes left Engie later in the same year and joined a large steel manufacturer. \u201cIt\u2019s probably necessary for the UK to get out of coal, as there had been no investment in technology to capture emissions or to run more efficiently,\u201d he says. \u201cWe could probably have burned coal in a clean manner if as a nation we had chosen to do so, and that would have given us greater options. From a diversity point of view and for the overall capacity that we will need, it\u2019s a bit of a shame that we will lose coal as an option.\u201d\nAt the Ratcliffe-on-Soar site, around 40 members of staff will leave this month on voluntary severance. Around 25 have secured future roles within the plant\u2019s owner Uniper and elsewhere, says O\u2019Grady. \u201cWe will be taking around 120 people into the decommissioning team, which has given people the confidence to stay with us through these final years, and we will continue to work with staff over the period of decommissioning to help them secure their futures,\u201d he says.\nAside from coal-fired plants and mines, millions have been employed over the years in running the logistics chain, getting the fuel from domestic \u2013 or foreign \u2013 production facilities to the generators. With just 3m tonnes of coal last year entering the country by sea, from a record 51m tonnes in 2006, a spokesperson for Associated British Ports (ABP) \u2013 which owns the UK\u2019s largest coal-import port, at Immingham in Lincolnshire \u2013 says the country\u2019s terminals have had to adapt.\n\u201cThe UK\u2019s ports have constantly evolved over the centuries [and] that remains the case today, with ABP\u2019s ports having reduced the volumes of carbon-intensive commodities they handle now leading the way on enabling the supply chains for green products and services,\u201d he says.\nYaxley reckons the UK perhaps missed some opportunities in the latter years of coal. \u201cIronically, I spent years and years banging on about security of supply and the risk of relying on global markets, sort of before it became fashionable. But now, of course, everybody\u2019s suddenly aware of this.\u201d\nHe questions the new Labour government\u2019s energy strategy following the Conservative Party\u2019s steady rule since 2010. \u201cThe new Labour government thinks the answer to security of supply is simply building loads and loads of renewables. But this doesn\u2019t solve the problem of intermittency, and the failure to pursue carbon capture and storage technology, associated with coal, has been a major lost opportunity for the UK. This is what global leadership on climate change would have looked like.\u201d\nTime to move onThere is a clear sense of nostalgia and some regret amongst former UK coal-industry workers. The world\u2019s first coal-fired power station came online in London in 1882. Since then, coal powered the country through the final two decades of Queen Victoria\u2019s reign, the roaring Twenties, the Blitz, the psychedelic 60s, the birth of the internet, the Spice Girls, and well into the new millennium. However, there is also an acceptance that the country no longer needs this fuel.\n\u201cI view coal as having done its job [although] we\u2019ve got to be very careful not to celebrate the loss of jobs and the economic deprivation that the loss of coal in some communities has caused,\u201d says Heppenstall.\u00a0 \u201cBut clearly there\u2019s something going on with the climate and all responsible countries have got to take action. I think future generations will look back and thank us, whilst it\u2019s painful now.\u201d",

        "subtitle":"(Montel) The EU would have to sanction Russian LNG to increase US supplies and improve relations ahead of potential tariffs under the incoming US administration of Donald Trump, analysts told Montel this week.",
        "body":"Their comments came after Ursula von der Leyen last Friday told reporters that US LNG supply could support \u201ctrade deficit\u201d discussions, adding: \u201cWe still get a lot of LNG from Russia and why not replace it with American LNG?\u201d\n\u201cIt absolutely makes sense to offer this,\u201d said Andreas Schroeder, head of energy analytics at Icis. \u201cThe US is a reliable partner and Europe is in desperate need for gas at least for 10 years and it just makes sense\u2026 while also playing into reducing the trade deficit.\u201d\nAfter Trump imposed a slew of tariffs in his first presidential term, he promised more in his latest campaign. Although he has focused mainly on China, he has also called the EU a \u201cmini China\u201d.\nHowever, EU and member state policymakers may be limited in how much they can do to increase US LNG supplies.\n\u201cThe intention is to get more US LNG, but there is nothing Leyen or Trump can do there,\u201d said Mike Fulwood, senior research fellow in the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, adding that the decision was in the hands of offtakers and buyers.\nGrowing consensus?Sanctioning Russian LNG would pave the way for more US imports by opening a supply gap that European companies could fill, analysts said.\nEurope was on track to import similar volumes of Russian LNG this year as the record set in 2022 of around 20bcm, according to preliminary Kpler ship-tracking data.\nThe continent was currently in dire need of Russian LNG, said Massimo Di Odoardo, vice president of gas and LNG research at Wood Mackenzie, but when global production capacity vastly increased from 2026\/27, it could cut its dependence.\n\u201cIf Europe imports less Russian LNG, inevitably it will be compensated by more US LNG,\u201d he said. \u201cMy perception is that consensus is growing among EU countries for sanctions on Russian LNG.\u201d\nSanctionsAdditionally, the EU would need to sanction Russian LNG to exit Russian gas by 2027, said Schroeder, referring to the EU\u2019s non-binding goal to end Russian gas imports by that year.\nThe European Commission aims to present a roadmap early next year for ending Russian gas imports to the EU before 2027.\nHowever, the EU lacked consensus on sanctions, said analysts. \u201cIt seems highly unlikely they would sanction Russian LNG,\u201d said Fulwood.\nSchroeder was also sceptical: \u201cI don\u2019t see sanctions coming so quickly. So far, they haven\u2019t managed to agree on sanctions, not just because of Hungary, but because of the French position because Total has too much to lose,\u201d he said, noting the only agreement to date had been on transshipments.\nBut without sanctions, EU buyers cannot break long-term supply agreements with Russia to replace with US LNG.\nLong-term dealsThe EU could implement policies to entice companies, analysts agreed.\n\u201cThe EU could create a more benign policy framework that provides more clarity for European utilities to contract more US LNG. European buyers can certainly commit more to buying US LNG,\u201d said Massimo Di Odoardo, vice president of gas and LNG research at Wood Mackenzie.\n\u201cFor the EU to use US LNG as a bargaining chip to limit US tariffs, the EU would need to support more long-term contracts to facilitate more US FIDs [final investment decisions].\u201d\n\u201cWith the US you could find agreement for 10-year contracts, with much more flexibility,\u201d said Schroeder. \u201cIt\u2019s something to offer to the Americans.\u201d",

        "body":"Nach einer vergleichsweise ruhigen ersten Wochenh\u00c3\u00a4lfte in der KW 46 konnte sich auch zum Wochenausklang keine Marktpartei bei den Emissionsrechten klar durchsetzen. Am Donnerstag legten die EUAs um 2,9 Prozent auf 68,26 Euro\/t CO2 zu, doch der Freitag brachte eine leichte Korrektur. Mit einem Schlusskurs von 67,44 Euro\/t CO2 verzeichnete der Dezember-24-Future ein kleines Wochenminus von 0,4 Prozent.Die Handelswoche 47 er\u00c3\u00b6ffnete hingegen mit einer klar bullishen Tendenz. Am Montag ging es f\u00c3\u00bcr die EUAs mit einem Schlusskurs von 69,55 Euro\/t CO2 um 3,1 Prozent nach oben. Mit einem Tageshoch von 70,03 Euro\/t CO2 wurde zudem die 70-Euro-Marke getestet. Am Dienstag setzte eine leichte Abk\u00c3\u00bchlung ein, und die CO2-Zertifikate schlossen bei 68,4 Euro\/t CO2 (minus 1,7 Prozent). Am Mittwoch stieg der Preis intraday bis zu einem Tageshoch von 69,40 Euro\/t CO2, schloss jedoch nahezu unver\u00c3\u00a4ndert bei 68,35 Euro\/t CO2. Am Donnerstag \u00c3\u00bcbernahmen die CO2-Bullen erneut das Handelszepter. Um 13:30 Uhr notierte der EUA Dez.24-Future 2,5 Prozent fester bei 70,05 Euro\/t CO2.Spekulanten im EU-ETS jetzt Netto-LongGest\u00c3\u00bctzt werden die EUAs auch durch das gestiegene Kaufinteresse der spekulativen Marktteilnehmer. Was sich zuletzt angedeutet hatte, wurde in der vergangenen Woche Realit\u00c3\u00a4t: Trotz einer relativ moderaten Wochenver\u00c3\u00a4nderung in KW 46 haben Investmentfonds im EU-ETS mit Datenstand 15.11. ihre Positionierung von Netto-Short auf Netto-Long gedreht. Nach einer Netto-Short-Position von 2,6 Mio. EUAs in KW 45 sind die Spekulanten in KW 46 mit 1,6 Mio. EUAs Netto-Long. Dabei wurde die Long-Position um 2,4 Mio. EUAs auf 47,0 Mio. EUAs erh\u00c3\u00b6ht, w\u00c3\u00a4hrend die Short-Position um 1,7 Mio. EUAs auf 45,4 Mio. EUAs reduziert wurde. Mit dem kr\u00c3\u00a4ftigen Anstieg in der aktuellen Handelswoche d\u00c3\u00bcrfte sich die Long-Position weiter ausgebaut haben. Der Wechsel auf eine Netto-Long-Position ist als bullishes Signal zu werten, da Investoren offensichtlich den Boden der EUAs als erreicht ansehen.Anstieg der Kohleverstromung st\u00c3\u00bctzt CO2-NachfrageAuch die Charttechnik spricht derzeit f\u00c3\u00bcr steigende CO2-Preise. Seit Anfang November hat sich beim Dezember-Future eine untere Umkehr in Form einer inversen SKS-Formation herausgebildet, und die EUAs befinden sich seither in einem Aufw\u00c3\u00a4rtstrend. Die Preise liegen inzwischen oberhalb der gleitenden Durchschnitte der letzten 20, 50 und 200 Tage, was den Aufw\u00c3\u00a4rtstrend best\u00c3\u00a4tigt. Fundamentale Faktoren, wie die gestiegenen Gaspreise, st\u00c3\u00bctzen die Verschmutzungsrechte zus\u00c3\u00a4tzlich. Da Kohlekraftwerke in der Merit Order vor Gaskraftwerken stehen, f\u00c3\u00bchrt dies zu einer h\u00c3\u00b6heren Nachfrage nach EUAs.Preisanstiege am Prim\u00c3\u00a4rmarktAm Prim\u00c3\u00a4rmarkt ging es zuletzt ebenfalls mehrheitlich aufw\u00c3\u00a4rts. Nach einem Auktionspreis von 66,78 Euro\/t CO2 am vergangenen Freitag, stieg der Preis der Auktion am Montag auf 67,70 Euro\/t CO2 (Bid-to-Cover Ratio: 1,63). Am Dienstag verzeichnete die Versteigerung dann einen kr\u00c3\u00a4ftigen Preisanstieg auf 69,05 Euro\/t CO2 (Cover Ratio: 1,36). Bei der polnischen Auktion am Mittwoch fiel der Preis auf 68,02 Euro\/t CO2 zur\u00c3\u00bcck (Cover Ratio: 1,74).

        "body":"Italy, the EU\u2019s third largest solar market in 2023, saw a 41% increase or nearly 3.9 GW in installations in the January-July period, putting the country on track for its strongest year in solar power development, it added in a new study. Germany reported a year-on-year growth of 11% or 9.3 GW over the same period, while Portugal doubled its solar installations in the first seven months year on year, adding about 0.9 GW of new capacity. Germany was on track to add a total of 17 GW solar capacity this year, while Italy should add 7.4 GW and Portugal should add 2 GW, Ember told Montel. \u201cIn Germany, reforms to reduce bureaucracy and boost incentives for rooftop solar installations have led to significant solar capacity additions continuing into 2024,\u201d it said. \u201cThis is consistent with the pace required to meet their new [national energy and climate plan] target of 128 GW capacity by 2026.\u201d Euan Graham, an electricity data analyst at Ember, emphasised the importance of planning for this rapid growth. \u201cIt\u2019s more ugent than ever for member states to plan accordingly, ensuring they have the power grids and enhanced flexibility to make the most of cheap solar power,\u201d he added. Storage challenge Ember saw the main challenge as ensuring sufficient grid capacity to deliver power where it is needed and expanding battery storage capacity to support solar generation beyond peak sunlight hours. \u201cIf these actions are taken, solar power could easily surpass expectations throughout the rest of the decade,\u201d the report added. Ember\u2019s report covers 15 countries worldwide, including those responsible for 80% of global solar installations in 2023. Five countries \u2013 China, the US, India, Germany and Brazil \u2013 are on track to make up 75% of global solar additions in 2024. \u201cThe massive step up in solar capacity installations in 2023 and 2024 has shifted perceptions around solar\u2019s role in the energy transition,\u201d the report said. \u201cSolar will likely add more GWs in 2024 than the entire global increase in coal power capacity since 2010 (540 GW).",

        "body":"Nach einem vergleichsweise ruhigen Handel in der ersten H\u00c3\u00a4lfte der KW 45 nahm das Kaufinteresse zum Wochenende hin deutlich zu. Nach einem Tagestief bei 63,65 Euro\/t CO2 stieg der EUA-Dezember-24-Future am vergangenen Donnerstag bis Handelsschluss noch um 3,4 Prozent auf 66,25 Euro\/t CO2. Am Freitag setzte sich der Aufw\u00c3\u00a4rtstrend mit einem Tages- und Wochenhoch bei 68,28 Euro\/t CO2 fort. Aus der Handelswoche ging es dann mit einem Wochenplus von 5,8 Prozent auf 67,69 Euro\/t CO2. Das Wochentief wurde bei 62,37 Euro\/t CO2 markiert. Eine geringe Windeinspeisung hat zu einem starken Anstieg der Stromproduktion aus konventionellen Kraftwerken gef\u00c3\u00bchrt. Dies hat auch die Nachfrage nach CO2-Zertifikaten gest\u00c3\u00bctzt und die Preise getrieben.Am Montag der Handelswoche 46 ging es zun\u00c3\u00a4chst weiter aufw\u00c3\u00a4rts, und das Verschmutzungsrecht erreichte ein Hoch von 68,8 Euro\/t CO2. Die EUAs schlossen mit einem kleinen Minus von 0,1 Prozent bei 67,6 Euro\/t CO2. Am Dienstag kehrte sich das Bild um, und der zwischenzeitliche Verkaufsdruck lie\u00c3? im Handelsverlauf wieder nach. Nach einem Tagestief bei 65,76 Euro\/t CO2 stabilisierten sich die Kurse und beendeten den Handelstag bei 67,14 Euro\/t CO2 (minus 0,7 Prozent). Am Mittwoch fiel das Verschmutzungsrecht auf ein Tief von 65,39 Euro\/t CO2, schloss jedoch bei 66,37 Euro\/t CO2 (minus 1,2 Prozent). Am Donnerstag sorgen Meldungen zu m\u00c3\u00b6glichen Einschr\u00c3\u00a4nkungen des Gasangebots f\u00c3\u00bcr Kaufinteresse an den Energiem\u00c3\u00a4rkten, was auch auf die CO2-Zertifikate abf\u00c3\u00a4rbt. Um 12 Uhr notierte der EUA-Dezember-Future 2,4 Prozent fester bei 67,96 Euro\/t CO2.Investmentfonds senken Netto-Shortposition weiterDie Investmentfonds im EU-ETS haben ihre Netto-Shortposition in der vergangenen Woche deutlich reduziert. Nachdem sich diese bereits in KW 44 um 4,5 Mio. EUAs auf 10,6 Mio. EUAs verringert hatte, sank die Netto-Shortposition mit Stand 8. November um 8,1 Mio. EUAs auf 2,5 Mio. EUAs und damit auf den niedrigsten Stand seit 15 Monaten. Insbesondere die Long-Positionen wurden erh\u00c3\u00b6ht, und zwar um 5,4 Mio. EUAs auf 44,5 Mio. EUAs. Die Short-Positionen reduzierten sich um 2,8 Mio. EUAs auf 47,1 Mio. EUAs. Angesichts der geopolitischen Unsicherheiten und einer starken Nachfrage durch die Dunkelflaute in der Vorwoche ist die Stimmung der spekulativen Marktteilnehmer offenbar nicht mehr bearish. Sollte die Position in n\u00c3\u00a4chster Zeit gar auf Netto-Long gedreht werden, w\u00c3\u00a4re dies als bullishes Signal zu werten.Weltweite CO2-Emissionen steigen weiter anLaut einer Studie des Global Carbon Project (GCP) wird die EU ihre CO2-Emissionen in diesem Jahr voraussichtlich um fast 4 Prozent senken. Dies ist zum einen auf h\u00c3\u00b6here Einspeisungen der erneuerbaren Energien zur\u00c3\u00bcckzuf\u00c3\u00bchren. Da der Grund jedoch auch bei der schwachen Wirtschaft liegt, ist die Zahl nicht ganz so positiv zu betrachten. Zudem werden die globalen Emissionen in diesem Jahr voraussichtlich 37,4 Mrd. t erreichen, was einem Anstieg von 0,8 Prozent gegen\u00c3\u00bcber dem Vorjahr entspricht. Die Kohle macht weiterhin den gr\u00c3\u00b6\u00c3?ten Anteil der fossilen Energietr\u00c3\u00a4ger aus, allerdings nehmen die Emissionen aus der Kohleverbrennung aktuell nur leicht zu (plus 0,2 Prozent) im Vergleich zu den h\u00c3\u00b6heren Anstiegen bei \u00c3?l (plus 0,9 Prozent) und Gas (plus 2,4 Prozent). Besonders auff\u00c3\u00a4llig ist der starke Anstieg des CO2-Aussto\u00c3?es in Indien im Jahr 2024 (plus 4,6 Prozent) \u00e2?? und zwar bei allen Energietr\u00c3\u00a4gern. Laut Judith Hauck, Umweltforscherin am Alfred-Wegener-Institut (AWI), w\u00c3\u00a4chst der Energiebedarf dort schneller als der Ausbau erneuerbarer Energien. In China hingegen steigen die CO2-Emissionen nur leicht um 0,2 Prozent, wobei die Emissionen aus \u00c3?l sogar zur\u00c3\u00bcckgehen. Dies h\u00c3\u00a4ngt laut Hauck mit der Mobilit\u00c3\u00a4tswende hin zur Elektromobilit\u00c3\u00a4t zusammen, die in China bereits fortschreitet.\u00e2?\u008d",
