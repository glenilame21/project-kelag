        "subtitle":"New IEA report shows tripling renewables and doubling energy efficiency are feasible with the right enabling conditions, offering North Star for national policies and international cooperation",
        "body":"Full implementation of the landmark energy goals established at the COP28 climate conference in Dubai last year would drive down greenhouse gas emissions and significantly accelerate the transformation of the global energy sector, according to a new IEA report that can serve as a guidebook for turning countries\u2019 collective pledges into action.At COP28, nearly 200\u00a0countries agreed to work towards an ambitious set of global energy objectives as part of the outcome known as the UAE Consensus \u2013 pledging to achieve net zero emissions from the global energy sector by 2050, transition away from fossil fuels, triple renewable energy capacity and double the rate of energy efficiency improvements by 2030, and accelerate the deployment of other low-emissions technologies. The new IEA report, From Taking Stock to Taking Action: How to implement the COP28 energy goals, is the first comprehensive global analysis of what putting the targets into practice would achieve \u2013 and how it can be done.The report highlights the feasibility of achieving the tripling and doubling goals, in particular \u2013 though it stresses that this will hinge on additional international efforts to set the right enabling conditions, as well as on countries using the UAE Consensus as the compass for their next round of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement.\u201cThe goals set by nearly 200\u00a0countries at COP28 can be transformative for the global energy sector, putting it on a fast track towards a more secure, affordable and sustainable future. To ensure the world doesn\u2019t miss this huge opportunity, the focus must shift rapidly to implementation,\u201d said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol. \u201cAs this new IEA report shows, the COP28 energy goals should lay the foundation for countries\u2019 new climate targets under the Paris Agreement \u2013 they are the North Star for what the energy sector needs to do. And further international cooperation is vital to deliver fit-for-purpose grids, sufficient energy storage and faster electrification, which are integral to move clean energy transitions quickly and securely.\u201dAccording to the report, the goal of tripling global renewable energy capacity by 2030 is within reach thanks to favourable economics, ample manufacturing potential and strong policies. But greater capacity does not automatically mean that more renewable electricity will clean up the world\u2019s power systems, lower costs for consumers and slash fossil fuel use.To unlock the full benefits of the tripling goal, countries need to make a concerted push to build and modernise 25\u00a0million\u00a0kilometres of electricity grids by 2030, according to the report. The world would also need 1\u00a0500\u00a0gigawatts (GW) of energy storage capacity by 2030, of which 1\u00a0200\u00a0GW needs to come from battery storage, a 15-fold increase on today\u2019s level.The report emphasises the need for a more granular, country-specific approach to achieving the critical goal of doubling energy efficiency by 2030. Doing so would potentially cut global energy costs by almost 10%, reduce emissions by 6.5\u00a0billion\u00a0tonnes, and strengthen countries\u2019 energy security.Yet getting there requires that governments around the world make energy efficiency a much greater policy priority and focus relentlessly on key actions. For advanced economies, this means homing in on electrification, given that doubling efficiency requires pushing electricity\u2019s share of global energy consumption towards 30% by 2030. The report notes that electric vehicles and heat pumps are significantly more efficient than their traditional alternatives. Meanwhile, for emerging economies, stronger efficiency standards \u2013 particularly for cooling equipment such as air conditioners \u2013 are vital for faster progress. And for countries without full access to modern forms of energy, achieving the Sustainable Development Goal of universal access to clean cooking supplies significantly reduces energy demand, transforms lives and livelihoods, and prevents millions of early deaths.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The report finds that fully achieving the COP28 goals for renewables and efficiency would cut global emissions by 10\u00a0billion\u00a0tonnes by 2030 compared with what is otherwise expected, helping to give the world a fighting chance of meeting the Paris Agreement\u2019s temperature goals. It also sets out key energy sector benchmarks for countries to consider as they design supportive new NDCs, which are due in 2025.The report was released during the United Nations General Assembly in New York, which coincides with Climate Week NYC. Over the course of the week, leaders from across government, industry and civil society are gathering to discuss opportunities for greater action on energy, climate and sustainable development issues. Alongside these events, the IEA is hosting the third in its current series of High-Level Energy Transition Dialogues in collaboration with the COP29 Presidency. The dialogue with global decision makers in New York City will focus on the findings of this report and next steps.In addition to the release of the COP28 report, the IEA also updated its Climate Pledges Explorer. The interactive online tool provides granular information on medium- and long-term climate plans for more than 190 countries, including estimates for implied emissions reductions within the energy sector. It also features a list of all net zero pledges globally, including their legal status and target year.",

Angesichts der schwachen Wirtschaftsdaten blicken die spekulativen Marktteilnehmer derweil jedoch weiter pessimistisch auf den europ\u00c3\u00a4ischen Emissionshandel und haben ihre Netto-Short-Positionen auf 26,2 Mio. EUAs erh\u00c3\u00b6ht, das h\u00c3\u00b6chste Niveau seit Mitte M\u00c3\u00a4rz. Dies entspricht einem Anstieg der Netto-Short-Position von 6,9 Mio. EUAs im Vergleich zur Vorwoche. Die Short-Positionen der spekulativen H\u00c3\u00a4ndler stiegen um 3,2 Mio. EUAs auf 66,5 Mio. EUAs, w\u00c3\u00a4hrend die Long-Positionen um 3,7 Mio. auf 40,3 Mio. EUAs abgebaut wurden. Dies ging einher mit einem Wochenverlust des Dez. 24-Futures von 7,5 Prozent in der KW 40.UBA untersucht Krisenfestigkeit des EU-ETSIn einem Rechtsgutachten hat das Umweltbundesamt (UBA) die Krisenfestigkeit des europ\u00c3\u00a4ischen Emissionshandels (EU-ETS) untersucht. Aktuelle Krisen wie der Krieg in der Ukraine und die Corona-Pandemie stellen das EU-ETS vor erhebliche Herausforderungen, besonders bei der Umsetzung der Verpflichtung zur Abgabe von Emissionszertifikaten. Eine Untersuchung der aktuellen Gesetzeslage auf EU- und nationaler Ebene zeigt einen deutlichen Bedarf an Anpassungen, insbesondere im Umgang mit Krisensituationen wie h\u00c3\u00b6herer Gewalt, Insolvenzen oder Betriebsstilllegungen. Verbesserungen sollten sich auf klarere Regelungen und das Schlie\u00c3?en von L\u00c3\u00bccken konzentrieren, wobei die Zusammenarbeit zwischen EU- und nationalen Beh\u00c3\u00b6rden zentral ist. Statt eines reinen Ma\u00c3?nahmenkatalogs wird der Einsatz von Verwaltungsinstrumenten, wie etwa die Sperrung von Zertifikatkonten, als sinnvoll erachtet. So soll den Beh\u00c3\u00b6rden mehr Spielraum gegeben werden, um die Abgabeverpflichtungen auch in Krisenzeiten sicherzustellen. Derzeit d\u00c3\u00bcrfen insolvenzgef\u00c3\u00a4hrdete Unternehmen ihre Zertifikate verkaufen, ohne zuvor ihre Emissionsverpflichtungen des Vorjahres zu erf\u00c3\u00bcllen. Dieses Vorgehen f\u00c3\u00bchrt zu einem \u00c3?berangebot an Zertifikaten, was die Preise belastet. Das UBA empfiehlt daher, nationalen Regierungen zu gestatten, Unternehmen daran zu hindern, Zertifikate zu verkaufen, bevor ihre Emissionen des Vorjahres gedeckt sind.Autor: Tobias Waniek von enerchase\u00c2\u00a0",

Angesichts der schwachen Konjunktur k\u00c3\u00b6nnte dies dazu f\u00c3\u00bchren, dass einige Unternehmen diese kostenlosen Zertifikate nutzen, um ihre Emissionen von 2023, die im September ausgeglichen werden m\u00c3\u00bcssen, zu decken, was die Nachfrage weiter reduziert, da weniger Zertifikate nachgekauft werden m\u00c3\u00bcssen. Die EU-Kommission hat einen Zwischenstand f\u00c3\u00bcr den Prozess der kostenlosen EUA-Zuteilungen in diesem Jahr vorgelegt (Datenstand 11. Juli). Demnach haben die Mitgliedstaaten 76 Prozent der vorgesehenen Zertifikate bereits zugeteilt. In Deutschland ist der Prozess nahezu abgeschlossen, die Zuteilungsrate liegt bereits bei 99 Prozent. Da der Prozess auf EU-Ebene noch weiterl\u00c3\u00a4uft, bleibt der Preisdruck f\u00c3\u00bcr die EUAs bestehen.Rekordwert bei der Stromerzeugung aus erneuerbaren EnergienWeniger CO2-Zertifikate wurden in diesem Jahr au\u00c3?erdem aus dem Stromsektor ben\u00c3\u00b6tigt, da die Stromerzeugung aus fossilen Brennstoffen im zweiten Quartal auf den niedrigsten Stand aller Zeiten gefallen ist, w\u00c3\u00a4hrend die Produktion aus erneuerbaren Energien stark zugenommen hat. Die Stromerzeugung aus fossilen Brennstoffen lag im zweiten Quartal bei 131,9 TWh, was den niedrigsten Wert aller Zeiten darstellt. Im Vergleich dazu ist die Solarenergie im zweiten Quartal auf 86,2 TWh angestiegen, was eine Steigerung um 15 Prozent zum Vorjahr bedeutet. Auch die Stromproduktion aus Windkraft hat um 9 Prozent auf 107,6 TWh zugenommen. Damit haben die erneuerbaren Energien im zweiten Quartal mit einem Anteil von 55,7 Prozent an der gesamten europ\u00c3\u00a4ischen Stromerzeugung einen Rekordwert markiert.Autor: Tobias Waniek",

        "subtitle":"(Montel) Asia\u2019s benchmark LNG price edged up over the last week amid a heatwave but remained in a tight range around USD12\/MMbtu, while Pacific bellwether coal rose on the prospects of higher Chinese demand.",
        "body":"Asia\u2019s JKM LNG benchmark front month contract for September rose USD 0.15 in the last week to settle on Wednesday at USD 12.24\/MMbtu (EUR 38.50\/MWh) in Nymex. Prices remained in a narrow range during the week between USD 12.01-12.24\/MMbtu.\n\u201cAsian demand has been stronger this summer primarily due to the heatwave that has kept LNG demand up in places like India and Thailand, and most recently in northeast Asia,\u201d said Zhi Xin Chong, senior director at S&P Global and head of emerging Asia gas and LNG markets.\nIndian buyers were also active in the spot market, said Australia\u2019s ANZ bank in a note. And Egypt is also seeking to buy five cargoes until mid-September, according to Kpler.\n\u201cThis helped the market shrug off the continued restart of the Freeport LNG plant, which was curtailed by Hurricane Beryl,\u201d said ANZ, referring to the second largest production facility in the US, which began a phased restart last week following damage earlier this month.\nStrong demandLNG demand is expected to remain robust this week in the region, with forecasts pointing to an increase of 12% to 5.4m tonnes, according to Kpler.\nJuly overall could see the highest imports since March, with deliveries of LNG in the month to date up 3.4% on the month to 18.4m tonnes, Kpler data showed.\nChong expected the JKM price to fall to about USD 10\/MMbtu for the September and October period amid high storage levels and weak demand in Europe.\nHowever, Asian prices should continue offering a premium to European equivalents until autumn, Montel reported yesterday.\nCoal gainsIn coal trading, broker Global Coal\u2019s Newcastle (Australia) index, a Pacific basin reference price for high-grade coal, was assessed last up by USD 2.03 \u2013 or 1.5% \u2013 on the week at USD 137.33\/t.\nThe rise came amid expectations from the International Energy Agency (IEA) of heightened demand in the second half of the year from the world\u2019s leading consumer, China. This was despite a lack of physical trades, with no spot cargoes for loading at the world\u2019s largest coal export hub, Newcastle, changing hands via Global Coal so far this week.\n\u201cPhysical markets remain lacklustre, failing to provide much colour with fairly wide bid-offer spreads,\u201d said the broker in a note to clients.\nThe IEA said in its mid-year coal market report published on Wednesday that renewables buildout was slowing down coal growth. \u201cBut another major annual increase in China\u2019s electricity demand, forecast at 6.5% in 2024, makes a decline in the country\u2019s coal consumption unlikely,\u201d it added.\nLNG imports, m tonnesThis week*Month to dateBangladesh0.070.32China1.534.82Hong Kong0.000.09India0.621.92Indonesia0.150.18Japan1.154.50Malaysia0.130.22Pakistan0.250.57Philippines0.000.07Singapore0.100.46South Korea0.732.74Taiwan0.471.63Thailand0.180.88Vietnam0.000.00Total5.3818.42\n*Vessel arrivals and forecast, according to Montel calculations based on Kpler estimates",
