        "body": "Nach einer schwachen ersten WochenhÃ¤lfte in der KW 28 meldeten sich die CO2-Bullen im weiteren Handelsverlauf noch zurÃ¼ck und reduzierten den Wochenverlust auf 1,4 Prozent (Schlusskurs: 69,35 Euro/t CO2). Das Wochentief lag bei 67,60 Euro/t CO2. Das Wochenhoch wurde bei 71,85 Euro/t CO2 markiert.Starker Verkaufsdruck am MittwochnachmittagDen Schwung aus dem festeren Handel zum Ausklang der vergangenen Woche nahmen die EUAs nicht in die KW 29 mit. Am Montag startete der CO2-Dezember-Future bearish in die neue Handelswoche und beendete den Handelstag 2,5 Prozent schwÃ¤cher bei 67,58 Euro/t CO2. Nach dem schwachen Wochenstart stabilisierte sich das CO2-Zertifikat leicht am Dienstag. Der EUA-Dez.24-Future beendete den Handelstag 0,5 Prozent im Plus bei 67,94 Euro/t CO2. Am Mittwoch gaben die CO2-BÃ¤ren insbesondere am Nachmittag den Takt auf dem Handelsparkett an. Nach einem Tageshoch bei 68,13 Euro/t CO2 stieg das Verkaufsinteresse in den spÃ¤teren Handelsstunden an, sodass das Verschmutzungsrecht auf Tagesschlusskursbasis 2,2 Prozent verlor und das BÃ¶rsenparkett bei 66,42 Euro/t CO2 verlieÃ?. Auch am Donnerstag hielten die CO2-BÃ¤ren das Handelszepter zunÃ¤chst weiter in den HÃ¤nden und markierten ein Tagestief bei 66,01 Euro/t CO2. Am Nachmittag gegen 16 Uhr stabilisiert sich der CO2-Kurs und handelt 0,6 Prozent fester bei 66,83 Euro/t CO2.Investoren wieder â??shorterâ??Der jÃ¼ngste CoT-Report fÃ¼r den Emissionshandel an der BÃ¶rse ICE Endex zeigt, dass die Investmentfonds wieder pessimistischer werden und die Netto-Short-Position erhÃ¶ht haben. Nachdem der Bericht mit Stand 5. Juli einen leichten Abbau der Netto-Short-Position zeigte, ist die Position mit Stand 12. Juli um 0,6 Mio. EUAs auf 18,1 Mio. EUAs angestiegen. BegrÃ¼ndet ist dies vor allem mit einem Abbau der Long-Position um 0,8 Mio. EUAs auf 36,5 Mio. EUAs, wÃ¤hrend die Short-Positionen um 0,1 Mio. EUAs auf 54,6 Mio. EUAs sanken.Kostenlose EUA-Zuteilungen zu 76 Prozent abgeschlossenBelastend fÃ¼r die EUAs ist die VerÃ¶ffentlichung der Daten zur kostenlosen Zuteilung von Zertifikaten an Industrie und WÃ¤rmeerzeugung fÃ¼r dieses Jahr durch die EuropÃ¤ische Kommission. Im Jahr 2024 werden 513,5 Mio. Tonnen kostenlose Zertifikate zugeteilt, das sind 12 Mio. Tonnen weniger als im Jahr 2023. Angesichts der schwachen Konjunktur kÃ¶nnte dies dazu fÃ¼hren, dass einige Unternehmen diese kostenlosen Zertifikate nutzen, um ihre Emissionen von 2023, die im September ausgeglichen werden mÃ¼ssen, zu decken, was die Nachfrage weiter reduziert, da weniger Zertifikate nachgekauft werden mÃ¼ssen. Die EU-Kommission hat einen Zwischenstand fÃ¼r den Prozess der kostenlosen EUA-Zuteilungen in diesem Jahr vorgelegt (Datenstand 11. Juli). Demnach haben die Mitgliedstaaten 76 Prozent der vorgesehenen Zertifikate bereits zugeteilt. In Deutschland ist der Prozess nahezu abgeschlossen, die Zuteilungsrate liegt bereits bei 99 Prozent. Da der Prozess auf EU-Ebene noch weiterlÃ¤uft, bleibt der Preisdruck fÃ¼r die EUAs bestehen.Rekordwert bei der Stromerzeugung aus erneuerbaren EnergienWeniger CO2-Zertifikate wurden in diesem Jahr auÃ?erdem aus dem Stromsektor benÃ¶tigt, da die Stromerzeugung aus fossilen Brennstoffen im zweiten Quartal auf den niedrigsten Stand aller Zeiten gefallen ist, wÃ¤hrend die Produktion aus erneuerbaren Energien stark zugenommen hat. Die Stromerzeugung aus fossilen Brennstoffen lag im zweiten Quartal bei 131,9 TWh, was den niedrigsten Wert aller Zeiten darstellt. Im Vergleich dazu ist die Solarenergie im zweiten Quartal auf 86,2 TWh angestiegen, was eine Steigerung um 15 Prozent zum Vorjahr bedeutet. Auch die Stromproduktion aus Windkraft hat um 9 Prozent auf 107,6 TWh zugenommen. Damit haben die erneuerbaren Energien im zweiten Quartal mit einem Anteil von 55,7 Prozent an der gesamten europÃ¤ischen Stromerzeugung einen Rekordwert markiert.Autor: Tobias Waniek",

It’s a problem,” said Alessandro Marangoni, CEO of consultancy firm Althesys.\nThe first green incentive scheme, known as Fer X, subsidises via auctions 40 GW of solar, 16.5 GW of wind and about 0.6 GW of hydropower and gas derived from purification processes until 2028. The auction prices are EUR 85/MWh for wind and solar and EUR 90/MWh for hydropower, according to a recent draft of the legislation seen by Montel. \nThe second subsidy scheme, Fer 2, aims to add nearly 4.6 GW of innovative and non-mature renewables capacity including offshore, thermodynamic solar units and geothermal plants until 2028, and sets offshore tariffs at EUR 185/MWh.\nUrgent revisionThe levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) – which indicates the cost of electricity generation required to make plants profitable – for Italian offshore wind is calculated at EUR 200/MWh, according to figures released at an Anev conference in Rome this week. \nThe Fer X and Fer 2 tariffs should be urgently revised for the auctions to be competitive, said Davide Tabarelli, president of think tank Nomisma Energia, while Fulvio Mamone Capria, president of offshore wind lobby group Aero, called for a 5-10% increase to account for inflationary pressures on raw materials.\nChallenges“Northern European wind power auctions have gone unawarded specifically because auction prices were considered too low,” Corrado Micozzi, CEO of energy forecasting company MycSolutions, told Montel.\nBoth Fer X and Fer 2 schemes faced opposite yet equally challenging situations, the industry leaders noted.\nFer X had abundant capacity to be allocated but limited authorised eligible projects, risking undersubscribed auctions, similar to the current Fer 1 scheme that struggled to allocate 8 GW since 2019, said Paolo Merli, CEO of renewables operator ERG, whereas Fer 2 had limited capacity but a plethora of projects seeking subsidies.",

Forecasts for lower wind generation in Germany, which often drives the dynamics of the Hungarian market, contributed to the hike.\nA technical error in the Czech Republic on Wednesday, which risked a full EU market decoupling, is also likely to have contributed to the Hungarian spot’s rise. \nThe Hungarian front-month was also bullish, last seen trading at EUR 104.45/MWh, a EUR 5.75 session-on-session increase.\nThe Hungarian market has recently been under a heavy bullish influence amid cross-border curtailments and heatwave-driven high demand. \nImproving supplySEE power markets kicked off the week at a bullish pace following unplanned maintenance on a 650 MW unit at Romania’s Cernavoda nuclear plant. \nThe outage weighed on supply and triggered price spikes across the flow-based market coupling members, impacting not only Romania, but also Greece and Bulgaria.\nThe latest data on the European TSO body Entso-E’s platform indicated that the unit will partly return on 25 July at 09:00 CET, but will only return fully at midnight on Thursday.\nThe Cernavoda outage led to Hungary losing its earlier premium over its Balkan counterparts, but this changed again during Wednesday’s session. Another expected unit return could offer some additional relief for Hungary.\n“In Hungary, if Dunamenti G3 [a gas-fired power unit] comes back as planned on 11 August, that could ease some of the tightness as well,” noted Gabor Szatmari, CEE territory manager at Montel Analytics.\nSupply tightness is set to ease in the next few days as a result of increased hydropower output.

And Egypt is also seeking to buy five cargoes until mid-September, according to Kpler.\n“This helped the market shrug off the continued restart of the Freeport LNG plant, which was curtailed by Hurricane Beryl,” said ANZ, referring to the second largest production facility in the US, which began a phased restart last week following damage earlier this month.\nStrong demandLNG demand is expected to remain robust this week in the region, with forecasts pointing to an increase of 12% to 5.4m tonnes, according to Kpler.\nJuly overall could see the highest imports since March, with deliveries of LNG in the month to date up 3.4% on the month to 18.4m tonnes, Kpler data showed.\nChong expected the JKM price to fall to about USD 10/MMbtu for the September and October period amid high storage levels and weak demand in Europe.\nHowever, Asian prices should continue offering a premium to European equivalents until autumn, Montel reported yesterday.\nCoal gainsIn coal trading, broker Global Coal’s Newcastle (Australia) index, a Pacific basin reference price for high-grade coal, was assessed last up by USD 2.03 – or 1.5% – on the week at USD 137.33/t.\nThe rise came amid expectations from the International Energy Agency (IEA) of heightened demand in the second half of the year from the world’s leading consumer, China. This was despite a lack of physical trades, with no spot cargoes for loading at the world’s largest coal export hub, Newcastle, changing hands via Global Coal so far this week.\n“Physical markets remain lacklustre, failing to provide much colour with fairly wide bid-offer spreads,” said the broker in a note to clients.\nThe IEA said in its mid-year coal market report published on Wednesday that renewables buildout was slowing down coal growth. “But another major annual increase in China’s electricity demand, forecast at 6.5% in 2024, makes a decline in the country’s coal consumption unlikely,” it added.\nLNG imports, m tonnesThis week*Month to dateBangladesh0.070.32China1.534.82Hong Kong0.000.09India0.621.92Indonesia0.150.18Japan1.154.50Malaysia0.130.22Pakistan0.250.57Philippines0.000.07Singapore0.100.46South Korea0.732.74Taiwan0.471.63Thailand0.180.88Vietnam0.000.00Total5.3818.42\n*Vessel arrivals and forecast, according to Montel calculations based on Kpler estimates",

On Monday, it had slumped to a 14-week low amid bearish fundamentals.\nCarbon was being buoyed by compliance buying and the absence of the fortnightly Polish auction, due to return next week, although market fundamentals remained bearish, analysts said.\nHowever, the auction hiatus was unlikely to drive prices up further, said Tom Lord of Redshaw Advisors in a note.\nAccording to Montel’s head of analysis Tom Hovik, technical signals suggested the carbon market was in the midst of an upwards correction. A close above EUR 67.49/t today could trigger a move towards EUR 69-70/t over the coming sessions, he said.\nGas, coal riseIn European gas markets, prices rose amid technical trading ahead of next week’s expiry of the front-month contract for August.\nThe benchmark Dutch TTF front-month product was last seen EUR 1.12 higher at EUR 32.74/MWh on Ice Endex.\n“August expiry is just a week away so there’s bound to be some heightened activity as people square off,” said a UK-based analyst, noting that the market would likely trade in a narrow range over the coming sessions unless there was a significant event impacting supply.\n“The bigger picture is it’s sideways until something fundamental happens,” he said.\nIn European coal markets, prices continued to rise despite a persistent absence of demand.\nThe API 2 front-month contract was last seen up by USD 2.40 to USD 112/t, surpassing the previous day’s four-session high of USD 110.05/t.\nIn addition to a seasonal lull, EU coal demand should dive 19% this year to its lowest on record amid renewables growth and stagnating power demand, the International Energy Agency said earlier.",

Der CO2 Dez. 24-Future schloss auf Wochensicht mit einem Minus von 4,8 Prozent bei 66,0 Euro/t CO2. Mit der ErÃ¶ffnung der Woche bei 69,58 Euro/t CO2 wurde auch das Wochenhoch markiert, da es im weiteren Handelsverlauf nur abwÃ¤rts ging. Das Wochentief lag knapp unterhalb des Wochenschlusskurses bei 65,72 Euro/t CO2.Kursrally am MittwochZum Wochenstart am Montag der KW 30 blieb das Verkaufsinteresse am CO2-Markt hoch. Das Verschmutzungsrecht verlor 1,8 Prozent und schloss den Handelstag bei 64,79 Euro/t CO2. Am Dienstag konnten sich die CO2-Bullen wieder zurÃ¼ckmelden. Das CO2-Zertifikat durchbrach die 65 Euro-Marke und beendete den Handelstag 1,5 Prozent im Plus bei 65,79 Euro/t CO2. Am Mittwoch dominierten die CO2-Bullen dann klar weiter das Handelsparkett. Bereits zur ErÃ¶ffnung zeigten sich die EUAs aufwÃ¤rtsgerichtet und der Kaufdruck blieb bis Handelsschluss hoch. Entsprechend schloss der EUA Dezember-Kontrakt 4,7 Prozent fester bei 68,90 Euro/t CO2. Eine Fortsetzung der AufwÃ¤rtsrally misslang den CO2-Bullen jedoch am Donnerstag.

Die Short-Positionen stiegen aber deutlicher um 7,1 Mio. EUAs auf 61,7 Mio. EUAs. Dies dÃ¼rfte den GroÃ?teil der KursschwÃ¤che der Vorwoche erklÃ¤ren. Am Montag ist der Dezember-Future dann auf eine wichtige charttechnische Marke bei 64,72 Euro/t CO2 gefallen, wo einige Spekulanten ihre Positionen offensichtlich im Gewinn geschlossen haben und die CO2-Preise gestÃ¼tzt haben. Dies wird der nÃ¤chste CoT-Report kommenden Mittwoch endgÃ¼ltig zeigen.Analysten sehen steigende EUA-PreiseGemÃ¤Ã? einer Reuters-Umfrage gehen Analysten fÃ¼r die Zeit von 2024 bis 2026 von steigenden EUA-Preisen aus. Im Durchschnitt liegt die Preisprognose der Analysten bei 67,25 Euro/t CO2 in diesem Jahr und 76,75 Euro/t CO2 im Jahr 2025. Dies entspricht einer Anhebung der Prognose im Vergleich zur letzten Umfrage im April um 5,1 Prozent fÃ¼r dieses und 3,7 Prozent fÃ¼r nÃ¤chstes Jahr. Die US-Bank Morgan Stanley sieht mit 73 Euro/t CO2 den hÃ¶chsten Preis fÃ¼r 2024, Capital Economics liegt mit einer Prognose von 63 Euro/t CO2 am niedrigsten.Risiken sehen die Analysten vor allem durch das â??Frontloadingâ?? der EU-Kommission. Dabei werden Zertifikate, die eigentlich erst 2027 bis 2030 versteigert werden sollten, auf frÃ¼here Auktionen in den Jahren 2023-2026 vorverlegt, um ErlÃ¶se fÃ¼r Reformvorhaben zu generieren. Aufgrund des gesunkenen Preisniveaus kÃ¶nnte die Politik gezwungen sein, weitere Mengen fÃ¼r das â??Frontloadingâ?? zu benennen, um die geplanten ErlÃ¶se zu erzielen. Das wÃ¼rde die Preise weiter belasten, die angesichts des hohen Angebots am PrimÃ¤rmarkt ohnehin bereits deutlich unter Druck stehen.Keine Halbierung der Zertifikatemenge im Monat AugustDie Auktionsmenge im August wird in diesem Jahr nicht wie in den vergangenen Jahren halbiert. Diese Halbierung hatte in der Vergangenheit die Preise der Zertifikate gestÃ¼tzt. Dies geschah im Rahmen von weiteren MaÃ?nahmen der EuropÃ¤ischen Kommission im vergangenen Jahr. So wurde neben dem Ende des AngebotsrÃ¼ckgangs im August u.a. auch die jÃ¤hrliche Compliance-Frist vom 30. April auf den 30. September verschoben und die Zuteilung der kostenlosen Zertifikate an die Industrie vom 28. Februar auf den 30. Juni. Da im August saisonbedingt die Nachfrage nach Zertifikaten geringer ist, fÃ¼hrt die Beibehaltung der vollen Auktionsmenge zu einer zusÃ¤tzlichen MarktsÃ¤ttigung.Autor: Tobias WaniekÂ ",

Combined wind and solar output was up 13.1% to 15.5 TWh, largely due to new installed capacity, which brought the total to 24.8 GW.\nMore reactors to comeMeanwhile, EDF said the initial blueprint for its plan to build at least six new reactors by 2050 had been approved by the French government and it was now starting work on the detailed reactor design.\nThe blueprint delivery for the planned new reactors was initially due by the end of last year.\nThe firm said it also received “all of the environmental authorisations needed to install the two reactors at the Penly” nuclear power plant along the channel coast where it plans to build the first of the new units.\nHowever, the company has struggled to build a third-generation EPR at its nuclear power plant in Flamanville, with massive cost overruns amounting to billions of euros and being delayed by over a decade.

        "body": "The country uses the auction for interruptible gas capacity to remunerate large industrial consumers that are ready to reduce their gas consumption during peak demand or system stress.\nSince its inception in 2020, it has struggled to gain widespread adoption, with auction bids consistently falling below the government-set limit of 12mcm/day but it gained traction last year after aggregation of companies was allowed and a bonus was offered.\n“This measure is vital for the security and stability of the country’s energy supply during the next winter,” said Gas Intensive in a statement.\nPotential imbalancesCiting data from TSO Snam, the lobby highlighted potential imbalances in the gas system for winter, “clearly showing the vulnerability of our energy system during peak demand periods”.\nIt also asked the regulator to maintain last year’s remuneration tariff of EUR 18/cubic metre, as it said it facilitated widespread participation, even though it was insufficient to reach the offered volume of 12mcm/day.\nOn a European level, the European Commission has already extended its emergency plan to reduce gas consumption by 15% until 31 March 2025. \n“This acknowledgment of the need for preventive measures on a continental scale underscores the severity of the situation and the necessity for adequate preparation,” the lobby said.\nUncertaintyMoreover, the expiration of the Russian gas transit contract through Ukraine in December added to the uncertainty amid expectations the contract would not be renewed, said Gas Intensive.\n“Although alternative solutions are being considered, their effectiveness and timing are not guaranteed, increasing the risk of supply disruptions during the winter of 2025, which could have severe repercussions for Italian consumers,” it said.\nThe lobby also saw risks from the shutdown of the Livorno regasification terminal, which will not resume operations until October, barring any delays, as well as the resurgence in Chinese LNG demand diverting supplies to Asia.\nParticipation in the interruptible scheme is offered for the January-March winter period through a yearly auction.\nA perceived high risk of the interruptible scheme being triggered in 2022 amid Europe’s energy price crisis and slump in pipeline gas supply deterred companies from participating in the auction for winter 2023 amid fears of non-compliance and subsequent hefty penalties.",

Das Wochenhoch wurde bei 69,04 Euro/t CO2 markiert.Kaufdruck nimmt am Donnerstag krÃ¤ftig zuDie Handelswoche 31 erÃ¶ffneten die CO2-Zertifikate am Montag mit starkem Kaufinteresse. Der EUA Dezember-Future schloss 1,6 Prozent fester bei 68,78 EUR/t CO2. Am Dienstag ging das Verschmutzungszertifikat nur mit einem kleinen Minus von 0,3 Prozent bei 68,58 Euro/t CO2 aus dem Handel. Intraday notierte das Emissionsrecht im Tagestief allerdings bereits deutlich tiefer bei 67,47 Euro/t CO2. Am Mittwoch nahmen die CO2-Bullen den Schwung des festeren Nachmittagshandels mit. Zwar ging es zwischenzeitlich bis auf 68,04 Euro/t CO2 im Tagestief abwÃ¤rts, stÃ¤rkerer Kaufdruck am Nachmittag fÃ¼hrte dann auf Tagesschlusskursbasis zu einem Plus von 1,0 Prozent auf 69,24 Euro/t CO2.

Solar- und Windenergie machten 30 Prozent der gesamten Stromerzeugung in der EU aus, wÃ¤hrend fossile Brennstoffe nur einen Anteil von 27 Prozent erreichten. Auch die Stromerzeugung aus Gaskraftwerken ging in der ersten JahreshÃ¤lfte um 14 Prozent zurÃ¼ck und erreichte nur 29 TWh, wÃ¤hrend die Stromerzeugung aus Wasserkraft im gleichen Zeitraum um 21 Prozent auf 33 TWh anstieg. Laut der Arbeitsgruppe Energiebilanzen (AGEB) sind die CO2-Emissionen in Deutschland in der ersten JahreshÃ¤lfte entsprechend um 17 Mio. t gesunken. Aufgrund der hohen Einspeisung der Erneuerbaren sank der Einsatz von Steinkohle zur Stromerzeugung im ersten Halbjahr 2024 um 42 Prozent gegenÃ¼ber dem Vorjahr. Die Stromerzeugung aus Braunkohle fiel im selben Zeitraum um 17,2 Prozent. Die BranchenverbÃ¤nde WindEurope und SolarPower Europe erwarten, dass die KapazitÃ¤ten von Wind- und Solaranlagen im Jahr 2024 15,8 GW bzw. 62 GW erreichen. Sollte dies realisiert werden, dÃ¼rfte die Stromerzeugung aus Wind- und Solaranlagen im ersten Halbjahr 2025 die konventionelle Erzeugung aus fossilen Brennstoffen Ã¼bertreffen.EEX verÃ¶ffentlicht aktualisierten AuktionskalenderDer jÃ¼ngste CoT-Report der BÃ¶rse ICE Endex zeigt, dass die Investmentfonds in der Woche zum 26.07.24 die Short-Positionen weiter ausgebaut haben und die Netto-Short-Position sich damit vergrÃ¶Ã?ert hat.

        "body": "The surge was due to increased nuclear output, a surplus of hydropower generation and persistently low demand, despite French solar and wind plants “frequently ramping down during periods of negative prices”, the report said.\nIn 2023, France regained its position as Europe’s largest net power exporter after becoming a net power importer for 2022, at around 17 TWh, for the first time in more than 40 years.\nMost power from France flowed to Britain, which received 11.7 TWh, while Italy, Germany and Switzerland received 9.4 TWh, 8.8 TWh and 7.4 TWh, respectively.\nSweden in second placeSweden was the second largest net power exporter in Europe in H1, at 15.3 TWh, and the Netherlands overtook Norway to become the third highest, at 8.8 TWh.\n“An increase in solar capacity and new offshore wind farms coming fully online were key reasons why the Netherlands leapfrogged Norway,” said Jean-Paul Harreman, director at Montel Analytics.\n“In contrast, Norway’s hydro reserves dropped… which reduced the pressure to dump cheap power into neighbouring countries.”\nMeanwhile, Italy remained Europe’s largest net power importer at 25.4 TWh, of which 9.4 TWh came from France and 10.3 TWh from Switzerland.

Nasrallah said Hezbollah would act regardless of the consequences.\nIG market strategist Jun Rong Yeap cautioned that any further upside momentum in oil would depend on whether there was any significant disruption to production or supply.\n“Geopolitical tensions continue to brew, but as per previous round of tensions in the region, oil price gains may be short-lived if retaliation moves are more contained and there is a lesser risk of an all-out regional war,” he said.\nGrowth concernsThe IG strategist said his more immediate concern was over the health of the global economy, particularly in the US and China, the world’s top oil consumers.\n“Brent crude prices have not been able to find much conviction for a bounce, as its demand outlook is brought into question with some reservations around the US growth picture,” he said.\nOn Tuesday, the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) said global crude oil consumption would reach around 104.5m bbl/day in 2025, down 0.2m bbl/day from a previous forecast, with demand growth set to be just 1.6%.\nThe downward revision comes amid concerns that China’s economy has been slowing with no clear signal of a possible turnaround.\nChina reported its slowest economic growth in five quarters last month, with traders and banks citing decreasing demand in Asia as a bearish factor for crude.\nOn Wednesday, China customs data showed that crude oil imports in July were down 9% to 42m tonnes compared to the previous month, as refiners, particularly the privately owned ones, cut runs to cope with poor margins.\nEmma Li, a senior analyst at Vortexa, said she was not optimistic about the outlook for demand growth to rebound in the next few months.",

        "body": "On Monday, the Biden administration appealed a federal court decision in January that ruled the US Department of Energy “must act expeditiously” on applications to export LNG to non-free trade agreement nations. The government had sought to pause the process.\nIf the appeal succeeds then that could further delay the review of pending non-FTA approvals, said Jason Feer, global head of business intelligence at consultancy Poten & Partners.\n“I think the approvals process is likely to resume after the election, but likely with new requirements that new applicants will have to clear,” Feer said.\nHe said more delays are likely because many projects will now have to reapply or seek an extension to non-FTA authorisations because they won’t have enough time to promote, finance and build their projects before their authorisations expire.\nThe appeal comes as Europe is hoping to import more US LNG later this decade amid efforts to wean off Russian gas.\nA court ruling without teethThe appeal marks the latest delay affecting companies with 12 large-scale projects or expansion plans that were under review at the time the pause was announced and that are still pending, according to figures from the Center for Liquefied Natural Gas.\nThe projects remain stalled regardless of the court decision in January, said Charlie Riedl, executive director at the Center for Liquefied Natural Gas, a Washington DC-based trade group.\n“There’s no teeth or enforcement mechanism that requires the DOE to take action,” Reidle said. “They’ve made it extremely difficult for project developers to challenge this.”\nFeer agreed. “The court did not set any deadlines and I don’t think there is any way to force the DOE to speed up its process, especially in light of the agency’s intention to change the requirements,” he said.\n“This is not necessarily a terrible thing – unless you are a project developer – as there is a huge amount of new LNG coming into the market between 2025 and 2028, so that will give the market some time to absorb that supply before additional projects come online,” he added.",

On Wednesday it peaked near USD 79/bbl, a level last seen on Friday.\n“Crude oil extended gains as the recovery from Monday’s sell-off continued,” said analysts at ANZ bank. “However, the gains were supported by renewed supply side issues.”\nThe ANZ analysts added: “The market has been on edge as it awaits a response from Iran. An aggressive response could lead to wider conflict in the Middle East and threaten oil supply. This has been exacerbated by production issues in Libya.”\nIran and its proxies have warned of retaliation against Israel following the recent killing of senior Hamas and Hezbollah leaders last week.\nDespite the heightened tensions in the Middle East, oil production in the region – which accounts for around 31% of global supply – continues to flow.\nUS inventories“Further falls in US inventories also supported the market,” ANZ said. “This suggests demand for physical barrels remains robust, despite concerns about weak economic activity.”  \nUS commercial crude oil inventories fell by 3.7m barrels last week to 429.3m barrels, which is around 6% below the five-year average, the US Energy Information Administration said late on Wednesday.\n“It is also the sixth consecutive week of crude oil stock declines. This leaves total commercial crude inventories at their lowest level since February,” said analysts at ING bank.\n“However, product numbers were less supportive,” ING said, pointing out that gasoline and distillate stocks rose by 1.34m barrels and 0.95m barrels, respectively. “Implied gasoline demand was also weaker, falling [0.28m bbl/day week on week] to below 9m bbl/day.”\nChina’s flagging oil importsThe analysts also pointed to flagging oil imports in China, the world’s biggest oil importer, for weighing on the market.\nChina’s oil imports in July averaged 10.1m bbl/day, down 3.1% year on year and 11.8% lower than the previous month. “This leaves cumulative imports over the first seven months of the year down 2.4% [year on year],” ING bank said.\n“Weaker Chinese oil demand was a key driver behind the weakness in oil prices over much of July.”",

So, the situation in the Nordics continues to look bearish,” said Djupskaas.\nThe wet weather would also improve the already healthy hydropower supply, Djupskaas said. Water reservoirs in Norway’s southeastern NO1 bidding zone, for example, should reach 90% full at the end of this week, while western Norway (NO5) looks to reach the same milestone late next week.\nIn the short term, various 10-day forecasts predicted precipitation equivalent to 5.4-9.8 TWh of hydropower output, compared with the average of 6.2 TWh, according to Montel Analytics.\nThe Nordic hydrological balance – potential hydropower output stored in reservoirs, snow and soil – should decrease slightly from 3.6 TWh below normal currently to 3.8 TWh below normal in a fortnight, Montel data showed. \nSpot to riseDjupskaas expected the Nordic system price for delivery on Tuesday to rise from today’s EUR 17.65/MWh, pegging it at EUR 23/MWh, amid forecasts for lower wind power output.\nMontel’s AI-based model pegged the day-ahead settlement at EUR 24.33/MWh.\nAverage wind power output should fall from 8.3 GW currently to 5.9 GW tomorrow, while consumption should be flat at 37.2 GW, Montel data showed.",

Trotz eines leichten RÃ¼ckgangs auf ein Tief bei 72,01 Euro/t CO2 schloss das Verschmutzungsrecht bei 73,14 Euro/t CO2. Am Dienstag erÃ¶ffnete der CO2-Markt bei 72,94 und erreichte ein neues Hoch von 74,75 Euro/t CO2, bevor er bei 73,07 Euro/t CO2 schloss. Obwohl der Schlusskurs unter dem Tageshoch lag, blieb die allgemeine Richtung zunÃ¤chst noch positiv. Doch am Mittwoch erÃ¶ffnete der Future bei 73,29 Euro/t CO2 und erreichte ein Hoch von 73,83 Euro/t CO2, bevor er auf ein Tief von 71,68 Euro/t CO2 fiel und bei 72,14 Euro/t CO2 den Handelstag beendete. Dies deutete bereits auf eine Umkehr des vorherigen positiven Trends hin. Am Tag der Erstellung dieses Marktberichts (Donnerstag) erÃ¶ffnete der CO2-Dez-Future bei 72,42 Euro/t CO2, erreichte ein bisheriges Tageshoch bei 72,64 Euro/t CO2 und stand am Nachmittag bei 71,36 Euro/t CO2. Dies zeigt weitere mÃ¶gliche Fortsetzung des PreisrÃ¼ckgangs, nachdem der Markt in den vorangegangenen Tagen bereits an Schwung verloren hatte.CO2-Preise profitieren von sinkenden KohlepreisenDie sinkenden Kohlepreise haben die CO2-Preise zunÃ¤chst weiter steigen lassen und am Dienstag zu einem Zwei-Monatshoch bei 74,75 Euro/t CO2 gefÃ¼hrt. Durch die im VerhÃ¤ltnis zu Gas niedrigeren Kohlepreise wird Kohle in der Stromerzeugung wettbewerbsfÃ¤higer, was zu einer erhÃ¶hten Nachfrage nach CO2-Zertifikaten fÃ¼hrt. Aufgrund der hohen Gaspreise befinden sich die Gewinnmargen von Gaskraftwerken derzeit im negativen Bereich, wÃ¤hrend die Gewinnmargen von Steinkohlekraftwerken im positiven Bereich liegen. Laut der Website des Fraunhofer ISE ist auch die Stromerzeugung aus Braunkohle im Vergleich zum Vorjahreszeitraum um etwa 20 Prozent auf 5.546 GWh gestiegen. Allein in der letzten Woche lag die Stromerzeugung aus Braunkohle um 24 Prozent hÃ¶her als im gleichen Zeitraum des Vorjahres und erreichte 1.378 GWh. Trotz dieser Entwicklungen bleibt die Kohlenachfrage in der Stromerzeugung insgesamt rÃ¼cklÃ¤ufig.CO2-Markt: Short-Position auf 3-MonatshochDie Netto-Short-Position spekulativer Investoren am CO2-Markt sind in der vergangenen Woche auf -6,8 Millionen Tonnen gestiegen und nÃ¤hern sich damit einem 3-Monatshoch. Dies markiert den dritten wÃ¶chentlichen Anstieg in Folge, begleitet von einem Anstieg der Long-Positionen um fast 6,5 Millionen Tonnen, dem grÃ¶Ã?ten wÃ¶chentlichen Zuwachs in diesem Jahr. Die gesamten Shortpositionen sanken auf knapp 49 Millionen Tonnen, was einem RÃ¼ckgang von 1,6 Millionen Tonnen im Vergleich zur Vorwoche entspricht.Â â?",

Der Markt bleibt insgesamt volatil und schwach, mit deutlichen PreisrÃ¼ckgÃ¤ngen, die auf eine anhaltende Unsicherheit und eine geringere Nachfrage nach CO2-Zertifikaten hindeuten. Die leichte Erholung am Dienstag mit einem Tageshoch bei 71,93 Euro/t CO2 konnte die allgemeine AbwÃ¤rtsbewegung jedoch nicht umkehren. Zum Zeitpunkt der Erstellung dieses Marktberichts stabilisieren sich die Preise kurzfristig auf der 70 Euro-Marke. Ein Rutsch unter dieses Level wÃ¼rde den kurzfristigen AbwÃ¤rtstrend seit dem Hoch vom 20.8. bei 74,75 Euro/t CO2 weiter fortbestehen lassen.Â Â Optionsverfall im SeptemberIm kommenden Monat werden die EUA September-Optionen verfallen. Verfallstag ist der 25. September. Der Basiswert dieser Optionen ist der EUA-Dezember-Kontrakt. Im Hinblick auf den nÃ¤her rÃ¼ckenden Verfallstag ist mit einer erhÃ¶hten VolatilitÃ¤t des Dezember-Kontrakts zu rechnen. Besonders viele Call-Optionen, die auf steigende Kurse setzen, liegen bei AusÃ¼bungspreisen von 75 Euro/t CO2 und 90 Euro/t CO2. Liegen die Kurse am Verfallstag darÃ¼ber, erzielen die OptionskÃ¤ufer einen Gewinn, liegen sie darunter, verfallen die Optionen wertlos. Bei den Put-Optionen, also den Wetten auf fallende Preise, sieht es anders aus: Die grÃ¶Ã?ten Positionen liegen bei AusÃ¼bungspreisen von 60 und 65 Euro/t CO2. Liegen die Kurse am Verfallstag darunter, sind die Optionsinhaber im Gewinn, liegen sie darÃ¼ber, verfallen die Optionen wertlos. Nimmt man alle Optionen am Markt zusammen und ermittelt, bei welchem Kurs die meisten Optionen, also sowohl Calls als auch Puts, wertlos verfallen, ergibt sich ein Kurs von 70 Euro/t CO2. Und genau dort steht der Kurs am Donnerstag, zum Zeitpunkt der Erstellung dieses Marktberichts. Sollte also am Verfallstag der Markt weiter in der NÃ¤he der 70 Euro-Marke liegen, profitieren die VerkÃ¤ufer (Stillhalter) der Optionen, also beispielsweise Investmentbanken, am meisten. Diese Optionen verfallen dann wertlos und die Stillhalter erzielen einen Gewinn in HÃ¶he der eingenommen OptionsprÃ¤mie.Abgabefrist 30. SeptemberIn diesem Jahr gibt es einige Ã?nderungen im europÃ¤ischen Emissionshandel: Zum einen entfÃ¤llt die Sommerpause im August. In den Vorjahren wurde im August jeweils nur die HÃ¤lfte der sonst Ã¼blichen Mengen verauktioniert. Dies ist in diesem Jahr nicht der Fall. Die Nachfrage in den Auktionen an der EEX ist in diesem Jahr weiterhin schwach, die durchschnittliche Cover Ratio, also das VerhÃ¤ltnis aus Angebot und Nachfrage in den Auktionen, liegt bei 1,69 und damit fast so niedrig wie zuletzt 2021. Die zweite wichtige Anpassung betrifft die Abgabefrist. Diese wurde vom 30. April auf den 30. September verschoben. Die abgabepflichtigen Unternehmen werden also in den nÃ¤chsten Wochen ermitteln, ob ihnen noch EUAs fehlen und ggf. ihre Position nachjustieren. In der Vergangenheit hat dies in der ersten AprilhÃ¤lfte zumeist die Kurse gestÃ¼tzt. In der zweiten AprilhÃ¤lfte hat die KaufaktivitÃ¤t dann allerdings nachgelassen. Dieses Muster ist mÃ¶glicherweise nun auch auf den September zu Ã¼bertragen.Weitere Reduzierung der Netto-Short-PositionDer gestern verÃ¶ffentlichte CoT-Report der BÃ¶rse ICE Endex auf die EUAs zeigte eine weitere Reduzierung der Netto-Short-Position. Die Investmentfonds sind nur noch mit minus 4,8 Mio. EUAs netto-short positioniert. Sie haben in den letzten Wochen ihre Netto-Short-Position von minus 25,5 Mio. EUAs Ende Juli auf minus 4,8 Mio. EUAs Ende August abgebaut. Im gleichen Zeitraum stieg auch der Preis fÃ¼r die Emissionsrechte um rund 15 Prozent. Die von den Spekulanten gehaltene gesamte Short-Position betrÃ¤gt 46,4 Mio. EUAs und die gesamte Long-Position belÃ¤uft sich auf 41,6 Mio. EUAs. Zum Vergleich: Deutschland verursachte im Jahr 2022 noch etwa 740 Millionen Tonnen CO2-Emissionen und im Jahr 2023 mit 673 Millionen Tonnen CO2 bereits weniger. Addiert man die Long- und Short-Positionen auf, so kommt man auf 88 Mio. Tonnen (46,4 + 41,6) spekulativ gehaltene Emissionsrechte allein an der ICE Endex. Dies sind wiederum rund 13 Prozent der gesamten deutschen Emissionen im Jahr 2023. Hierdurch wird deutlich, welche Marktmacht die Spekulanten im europÃ¤ischen Energiemarkt haben.Aufgrund der relativ gleich hohen Positionierung stehen sich CO2-Bulle und CO2-BÃ¤r am Markt fÃ¼r Emissionsrechte nun wieder gleich stark gegenÃ¼ber. Eine starke Kursreaktion oder die Gefahr eines â??Squeezeâ?? besteht derzeit nicht. Wir sind gespannt, fÃ¼r welche Richtung sich die Spekulanten kÃ¼nftig entscheiden. Bauen sie verstÃ¤rkt Long-Positionen auf, wird der Preis steigen, und vice versa.Autoren: Dennis Warschewitz, Stefan KÃ¼ster â?",

        "body": "The International Energy Agency (IEA) gathered about 80 experts from around the world at its headquarters in Paris today for a conference focused on expanding the role of nuclear power in secure and affordable energy transitions.Prominent stakeholders from government, industry, the financial sector, international organisations and academia discussed major hurdles and potential ways to address them, emphasising the importance of nuclear power in bolstering energy security and tackling climate change.IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol chaired the session on how public-private cooperation can enhance nuclear power, while IEA Director of Energy Markets and Security Keisuke Sadamori delivered the opening and closing remarks. Since the global energy crisis sparked by Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, countries have shown renewed interest in nuclear power – an important source of stable electricity supply that also plays a vital role in the IEA’s pathway for achieving net zero emissions from the global energy sector by mid-century. Twenty-five countries have now pledged to work towards tripling global nuclear power capacity by 2050. However, investment is not keeping up with ambition, as real and perceived cost, policy and construction risks restrain growth in the sector. Nuclear power also faces tough market competition, and developing and implementing innovative technologies that could accelerate growth will be crucial.Conference participants discussed these impediments as well as possible solutions, including mechanisms for managing and reducing project risks. Their insights will serve as a key input to a report the IEA is preparing on this topic scheduled for early 2025.",

        "subtitle": "New IEA report offers first-of-its-kind global stocktake of efforts to integrate variable renewables across 50 power systems, identifying best practices and key challenges",
        "body": "As solar PV and wind grow at an accelerated pace around the world, governments must act to ensure that they are well integrated into power systems – or risk losing out on significant benefits, according to a new report from the IEA.Integrating Solar and Wind: Global experience and emerging challenges, published today, explores one of the biggest hurdles for policy makers as clean energy transitions gather speed. Between 2018 and 2023, solar PV and wind capacity worldwide more than doubled, and their share of electricity generation nearly doubled. Fuelled by supportive government policies and continued cost reductions, the capacity of these renewable sources is projected to keep expanding rapidly towards 2030. Solar PV and wind are crucial technologies for decarbonisation – especially in the electricity sector, where they account for two-thirds of reductions in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions on a pathway towards net zero by mid-century.However, to maximise the advantages of this additional capacity, these variable renewable energy (VRE) sources need to be well integrated into power systems as they are deployed. According to the report, delaying the implementation of measures to support integration could result in electricity generation from solar PV and wind being 15% lower in 2030 and shave five percentage points off their share of the global electricity mix.“In recent years, the world has seen a remarkable increase in solar and wind capacity as countries have looked to bolster their energy security and reduce emissions. But they won’t reap the full benefits without stronger efforts to support the integration of these technologies into power systems,” said IEA Director of Energy Markets and Security Keisuke Sadamori. “This important new report lays out the challenges ahead, as well as how to tackle them. As global experience grows, so does our understanding of how to keep clean energy transitions moving forward securely.”The report features a first-of-its-kind global stocktake of integration measures across 50 power systems, which together account for nearly 90% of global solar PV and wind generation today. This includes updated country assessments using the IEA’s framework for the phases of variable renewable energy integration, which was originally developed in 2017 and last updated in 2019. According to the analysis, in a scenario in which countries meet their announced energy and climate goals, those that currently have low shares of variable renewable energy in their power mixes account for two-thirds of generation growth to 2030. They can typically boost deployment without enacting sweeping, system-wide changes. Well-known and tested measures such as enhancing the flexibility of existing assets and improved forecasting – implemented gradually as the need arises – tend to be sufficient.Tougher challenges typically materialise at higher levels of solar PV and wind penetration. However, frontrunner systems – including Denmark, Ireland, South Australia and Spain – are finding ways to address these issues, too, clearing the way for others. Developing storage and new power grid technologies, for example, is playing an important role in managing variations in solar PV and wind output throughout the day and across seasons.According to the report, most technological solutions to address emerging hurdles – namely, a higher need for stability and flexibility – are either mature or nearing maturity, and their successful rollout often lies in appropriate policy and regulatory action rather than new technological breakthroughs. Even so, incorporating higher levels of variable renewables into power systems requires rethinking the ways in which they have traditionally been planned and operated. This will necessitate proactive measures globally as the uptake of renewables continues apace.",

        "subtitle": "(Montel) Most of the EU’s top solar markets beat their 2023 records in the first seven months of the year and remain on track for a strong finish to 2024, energy think tank Ember said on Thursday.",
        "body": "Italy, the EU’s third largest solar market in 2023, saw a 41% increase or nearly 3.9 GW in installations in the January-July period, putting the country on track for its strongest year in solar power development, it added in a new study. Germany reported a year-on-year growth of 11% or 9.3 GW over the same period, while Portugal doubled its solar installations in the first seven months year on year, adding about 0.9 GW of new capacity. Germany was on track to add a total of 17 GW solar capacity this year, while Italy should add 7.4 GW and Portugal should add 2 GW, Ember told Montel. “In Germany, reforms to reduce bureaucracy and boost incentives for rooftop solar installations have led to significant solar capacity additions continuing into 2024,” it said. “This is consistent with the pace required to meet their new [national energy and climate plan] target of 128 GW capacity by 2026.” Euan Graham, an electricity data analyst at Ember, emphasised the importance of planning for this rapid growth. “It’s more ugent than ever for member states to plan accordingly, ensuring they have the power grids and enhanced flexibility to make the most of cheap solar power,” he added. Storage challenge Ember saw the main challenge as ensuring sufficient grid capacity to deliver power where it is needed and expanding battery storage capacity to support solar generation beyond peak sunlight hours. “If these actions are taken, solar power could easily surpass expectations throughout the rest of the decade,” the report added. Ember’s report covers 15 countries worldwide, including those responsible for 80% of global solar installations in 2023. Five countries – China, the US, India, Germany and Brazil – are on track to make up 75% of global solar additions in 2024. “The massive step up in solar capacity installations in 2023 and 2024 has shifted perceptions around solar’s role in the energy transition,” the report said. “Solar will likely add more GWs in 2024 than the entire global increase in coal power capacity since 2010 (540 GW).",

        "subtitle": "(Montel) European gas markets remain exposed to price pressure with the region’s energy security still under ongoing stress, highlighting the importance of strengthening the region’s southern LNG infrastructure, the head of Italian gas TSO Snam said on Tuesday.",
        "body": "“The gas market is still in a fragile equilibrium, and the very high volatility that has been characterising past months will also characterise the future, together with slow global supply growth and rising demand especially in Asia,” said Snam CEO Stefano Venier. \n“This puts pressure on Europe’s energy security and gas prices due to increased competition from imports.”\nThese factors must be taken into account as Europe’s reliance on LNG is increasing and “LNG is a global market”.\nMoscow’s war on Ukraine has seen the share of Russia’s pipeline gas in EU imports plunge from over 40% in 2021 to less than 10% last year. To help fill the gap, Europe has boosted LNG imports from countries like the US and Qatar. \nEurope’s southern infrastructure plays a crucial role both in short-term resilience and long-term energy diversification, prompting the continent to bolster its Mediterranean LNG supply routes, Venier said. \n“In the short term, this infrastructure will meet the needs of (Europe’s) 2024 gas demand, which is expected to remain resilient compared to 2023 levels in Europe,” Venier said. \n“In the long term, however, it needs to offer capacity diversification and reserve backup so as to meet higher demand driven by the new LNG capacity arriving to Europe.”\nSupply opportunitiesA robust “Euro-Mediterranean infrastructure” is essential to the continent’s southern supply route which permitted the region to switch out of Russian supplies, Venier said. \nEurope’s gas market already recently suffered supply growth constraints tied to the continent’s reliance on LNG “in response to the supply shocks we’ve had in recent years”, he said.\n“Think about how European supply dependence went from Russia to other suppliers, and to LNG imports” and the effects of this on the system, he added.\nVenier was speaking at a webinar on the International Gas Union’s most recent forecast, which was released last month and forecast that Europe’s gas demand could rise almost 1% this year. If realised, this would mark the first rise in demand since 2021.",

        "subtitle": "New IEA report shows tripling renewables and doubling energy efficiency are feasible with the right enabling conditions, offering North Star for national policies and international cooperation",
        "body": "Full implementation of the landmark energy goals established at the COP28 climate conference in Dubai last year would drive down greenhouse gas emissions and significantly accelerate the transformation of the global energy sector, according to a new IEA report that can serve as a guidebook for turning countries’ collective pledges into action.At COP28, nearly 200 countries agreed to work towards an ambitious set of global energy objectives as part of the outcome known as the UAE Consensus – pledging to achieve net zero emissions from the global energy sector by 2050, transition away from fossil fuels, triple renewable energy capacity and double the rate of energy efficiency improvements by 2030, and accelerate the deployment of other low-emissions technologies. The new IEA report, From Taking Stock to Taking Action: How to implement the COP28 energy goals, is the first comprehensive global analysis of what putting the targets into practice would achieve – and how it can be done.The report highlights the feasibility of achieving the tripling and doubling goals, in particular – though it stresses that this will hinge on additional international efforts to set the right enabling conditions, as well as on countries using the UAE Consensus as the compass for their next round of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement.“The goals set by nearly 200 countries at COP28 can be transformative for the global energy sector, putting it on a fast track towards a more secure, affordable and sustainable future. To ensure the world doesn’t miss this huge opportunity, the focus must shift rapidly to implementation,” said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol. “As this new IEA report shows, the COP28 energy goals should lay the foundation for countries’ new climate targets under the Paris Agreement – they are the North Star for what the energy sector needs to do. And further international cooperation is vital to deliver fit-for-purpose grids, sufficient energy storage and faster electrification, which are integral to move clean energy transitions quickly and securely.”According to the report, the goal of tripling global renewable energy capacity by 2030 is within reach thanks to favourable economics, ample manufacturing potential and strong policies. But greater capacity does not automatically mean that more renewable electricity will clean up the world’s power systems, lower costs for consumers and slash fossil fuel use.To unlock the full benefits of the tripling goal, countries need to make a concerted push to build and modernise 25 million kilometres of electricity grids by 2030, according to the report. The world would also need 1 500 gigawatts (GW) of energy storage capacity by 2030, of which 1 200 GW needs to come from battery storage, a 15-fold increase on today’s level.The report emphasises the need for a more granular, country-specific approach to achieving the critical goal of doubling energy efficiency by 2030. Doing so would potentially cut global energy costs by almost 10%, reduce emissions by 6.5 billion tonnes, and strengthen countries’ energy security.Yet getting there requires that governments around the world make energy efficiency a much greater policy priority and focus relentlessly on key actions. For advanced economies, this means homing in on electrification, given that doubling efficiency requires pushing electricity’s share of global energy consumption towards 30% by 2030. The report notes that electric vehicles and heat pumps are significantly more efficient than their traditional alternatives. Meanwhile, for emerging economies, stronger efficiency standards – particularly for cooling equipment such as air conditioners – are vital for faster progress. And for countries without full access to modern forms of energy, achieving the Sustainable Development Goal of universal access to clean cooking supplies significantly reduces energy demand, transforms lives and livelihoods, and prevents millions of early deaths.           The report finds that fully achieving the COP28 goals for renewables and efficiency would cut global emissions by 10 billion tonnes by 2030 compared with what is otherwise expected, helping to give the world a fighting chance of meeting the Paris Agreement’s temperature goals. It also sets out key energy sector benchmarks for countries to consider as they design supportive new NDCs, which are due in 2025.The report was released during the United Nations General Assembly in New York, which coincides with Climate Week NYC. Over the course of the week, leaders from across government, industry and civil society are gathering to discuss opportunities for greater action on energy, climate and sustainable development issues. Alongside these events, the IEA is hosting the third in its current series of High-Level Energy Transition Dialogues in collaboration with the COP29 Presidency. The dialogue with global decision makers in New York City will focus on the findings of this report and next steps.In addition to the release of the COP28 report, the IEA also updated its Climate Pledges Explorer. The interactive online tool provides granular information on medium- and long-term climate plans for more than 190 countries, including estimates for implied emissions reductions within the energy sector. It also features a list of all net zero pledges globally, including their legal status and target year.",

        "body": "Marco Saalfrank, head of continental Europe merchant trading, noted the continent’s gas storage levels were close to 95% of capacity, “so from this perspective, Europe is doing well”.\nBut he warned, in an interview on the sidelines of Energy Trading Week in London late on Tuesday, that September and October were already forecast to be colder than the last two years, when Europe benefited from “very mild” winters.\n“It could well be that we are going to have a normal winter again and this will bring higher demand,” he said.\nLess LNG“The weather is for sure one very important element. The other one is LNG,” he said, highlighting the ongoing risk of supply disruptions, linked for example to hurricane season until November in the US and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.\nThe plunge in Russian gas flows to Europe since the war in Ukraine began in early 2022 from more than 40% of the continent’s supply in 2021 to less than 10% last year had resulted in a heightened reliance on LNG, for which European traders must compete with Asian buyers for spot supplies, he said.\n“There is clearly less LNG floating around Europe than last year,” he said, noting this in part reflected some recovery in competing Asian demand.\nSupply fearsHe also pointed to the anticipated end of Russian gas transit shipments via Ukraine – amounting to an estimated 14bcm this year – at the end of December, and the lingering question mark over whether, or how, this supply would be replaced.\nAs such, Saalfrank said Europe had “lost a lot of flex” in gas, adding: “It’s really more tight than in the past.”\nThis left the market more sensitive to supply or demand developments, he said. “Due to the energy transition, we are losing the ability to go easily from gas to coal, and back to gas. If something happens, the market is reacting very fast – it’s extreme sentiment.”\n“We saw it with this fake news about transit last week, when we had a drop of EUR 3,” he said, regarding an erroneous news report last Thursday, that Azerbaijan would pump gas via Ukraine to Europe from next year. The report caused the continent’s benchmark front-month TTF gas contract to touch an eight-week low of EUR 32.04/MWh that day. It was last seen at EUR 36.20/MWh.\n“I expect more volatility and more swings,” he added.",

It said it was planning through its subsidiary Framatome to build a plant to manufacture pipes destined for the new-generation European pressurised reactors (EPRs) that president Emmanuel Macron had pledged to build.\nThe plant would employ around 100 staff at the onset, rising to around 200 at peak operation, EDF added.\n“Publicity stunt”However, CGT official Fabien Deschamps told Montel this would not be as good an option as the biomass conversion, which would enable EDF to keep all 350 jobs on site. He said he was afraid this announcement was just a “publicity stunt” to reassure local authorities.\nMacron said last year that France would convert its remaining coal plants, the Cordemais unit and 600 MW capacity Emile Huchet, operated by GazelEnergie, to biomass by 2027.\n“[Emmanuel] Macron’s word is therefore worthless… Of course, the jobs at Cordemais are at stake, but so is our energy transition and the credibility of the government in this,” hard-left LFI MP Maxime Laisney said on X.\n“[Prime minister] Michel Barnier’s new government urgently needs to remind the nationalised company that short-sighted accounting considerations can be very costly both financially and politically,” senator Philippe Grosvalet said on X, adding that this was “an unacceptable decision”.",

        "body": "Tinne Van der Straeten, Belgium’s energy minister, told the UK financial daily the EU must “go further” to stop Russian LNG reaching the bloc as concerns rise about an increase in imports.\nShe said that rules introduced by Brussels last December to prevent Russian energy companies using EU infrastructure did not give enough legal grounds for companies that used ports such as Belgium’s Zeebrugge — a major hub for LNG imports and re-export to third countries — to curtail contracts.\nLNG contracts generally run for a decade or more, so many currently in force date from before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n“We have looked into this… We have Russian gas coming into Belgium. I have looked under every stone, and the gas [legislation] is not going to help,” Van der Straeten told the FT. “We need a European approach.”\nThe EU has stopped short of introducing sanctions on the fuel beyond a ban on trans-shipments — the import and re-export of Russian LNG to other countries — which was agreed in June but has yet to come into force.\nAfter Spain, Belgium was the second-biggest importer of Russian LNG in 2023, with France likely to overtake Spain this year, according to the FT, citing data from analytics company Kpler.",

        "title": "Coal fades to black as UK shines light on green future",
        "subtitle": "(Montel) On an autumn day in 2010, perched on the banks of the river Thames, beside a 17th century fort and a field of windswept horses, the Tilbury B power plant in Essex was burning coal just as it had since it first fired up in the late 1960s. But change was afoot.",
        "body": "Tilbury B’s charismatic plant manager, Nigel Staves, saw a future in pellets. Wood pellets, a compressed form of woody biomass, would account for 100% of the burn “in the future”, he said, from just 10% at the time. Three years later the plant was shut down.\nCoal-fired power plants like Tilbury B helped drive the UK’s industrialisation and local economies for decades. In 2010, their fate was already sealed in legislation. Two years earlier, the secretary of state for energy and climate change at the time, the Labour Party’s Ed Miliband, announced that the Climate Change Act 2008 would mandate an 80% cut overall in six greenhouse gases by 2050.\nThe legislation came with legally binding carbon budgets, a way to ensure the nation’s greenhouse gas emissions, such as CO2, the main gas from burning coal, were curbed to specific levels in five-year periods. Coal accounted for 30% of the UK’s electricity mix in 2010. By 2016, the share dropped below 10%. Since 2022, it’s been less than 2%.\nThis week, the nation’s last coal-fired station, the 2 GW Ratcliffe-on-Soar plant in Nottinghamshire, extinguished its furnaces for good. There is much to celebrate in this achievement, given global efforts to cut down on carbon emissions, widely blamed for causing global climatic changes. Currently, UK waters boast the world’s second-largest fleet of offshore wind turbines, after China, in terms of installed nameplate capacity. Britain aims to decarbonise the power sector by 2035 and to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.\nBut there is no escaping the fact that the UK’s history, from both an industrial and social viewpoint, has been intrinsically linked, well beyond any living memory, to coal. “Coal closure in the UK is a tremendous milestone in decarbonisation, and should be recognised for that, but it is also a moment when people will leave the site and face great uncertainty about their futures,” says Peter O’Grady, Ratcliffe-on-Soar’s plant manager.\nA career in coalBruce Heppenstall started his career in coal, rising up to become plant director at the UK’s Drax power station, formerly the third-largest coal-fired plant in Europe but now running on biomass. The attraction, he said, was driven by “these huge plants…producing power to millions of homes” at low cost. “Coal was the UK’s choice because it was on hand. It powered the industrial revolution, making steam, and then cheap, affordable power.”\nThe Drax power station is huge. Its 12 massive cooling tours are visible for miles, with each taller than the dome of St Paul’s Cathedral. The power plant ultimately succeeded where Tilbury failed, in mapping out a life for itself beyond coal, by turning instead to wood pellets and some other biofuels. “As recently as the early 2000s it was clear that coal was becoming yesterday’s technology. And I think Drax Group took a huge leap of faith in moving across to using sustainable biomass. But thank goodness they did, because otherwise Drax would have been added to the list of power stations that would have closed,” says Heppenstall.\nInstead, Drax is this year celebrating half a century of generation at the plant. “I hope that in some 50 years’ time, somebody else is stood there celebrating a hundred years and these units are still taking carbon out of the atmosphere in a sustainable manner,” he says.\nShuttering minesThe UK’s coal industry has seen many changes and challenges over the past 100 years, not least the closure of mines which once fed the power plants, and an ensuing reliance on imported material, particularly since the late 1990s.  Shortly before the First World War, in 1913, the country produced nearly 300m tonnes of coal and was even a significant exporter of the fuel. But output had dropped to 130m tonnes by 1980 and just over 30m tonnes at the turn of the century.\nWith the closure of the UK’s last large surface mine, Ffos-y-Fran in Wales, at the end of November last year, there are no more large-scale surface mines left. Government data shows that production in the second quarter of this year fell to a new record quarterly low of just 19,000 tonnes.\nNigel Yaxley spent more than four decades working in the UK coal industry. Now retired, he looks back fondly on his career, and particularly the people he worked with over the years. “I was born in Sheffield and my grandfather worked down the pit near Barnsley, so I grew up very much surrounded by coal and was probably more aware of that than any other industry,” he says. “I was lucky enough to go to Cambridge and have a good education, but I guess whilst a lot of my colleagues were going into law and those sorts of professions I was, probably because of my background and upbringing, quite attracted to coal.”\nYaxley joined the National Coal Board in 1977, which ran the nationalist coal-mining industry, when there were approximately a quarter of a million people employed in coal mining in Britain. In the 1990s, as the number of mine workers fell to a little over 10,000, he worked for the country’s largest coal mining firm, UK Coal, and in the 2000s became managing director of the Association of UK Coal Importers and Producers, witnessing miner numbers dwindle to below 1,000 by the early 2020s.\n“A lot of the people I knew from the UK who were highly competent mining engineers moved to Australia or got involved in other international work of that type. There’s never any shortage of international consultancy work for good mining engineers. On the generation side, it was easier to simply move to different fuels, so you had people who went across to gas or went into other fuel areas. And quite a lot of people hung on to the bitter end, because it was what they were familiar with. But now is the bitter end of course.”\nTransitioning awayOne such trader who moved away from coal is Trevor Rhodes. Trading in the early 2010s for Engie’s 1 GW Rugeley B power plant, in Staffordshire, Rhodes helped to source 2-3m tonnes/year from Colombia and Russia to keep the plant running in its twilight years. “I started in 2011 and had been expecting to buy for a station that would run at about half capacity. However, by 2013 it was pretty much running flat out,” he says, noting a temporary drop in coal prices and stable carbon costs meant the plant was kept online longer than initially expected, for something of a last hurrah.\nHowever, it inevitably closed its doors for the last time in mid-2016, after around 46 years of service. Rhodes left Engie later in the same year and joined a large steel manufacturer. “It’s probably necessary for the UK to get out of coal, as there had been no investment in technology to capture emissions or to run more efficiently,” he says. “We could probably have burned coal in a clean manner if as a nation we had chosen to do so, and that would have given us greater options. From a diversity point of view and for the overall capacity that we will need, it’s a bit of a shame that we will lose coal as an option.”\nAt the Ratcliffe-on-Soar site, around 40 members of staff will leave this month on voluntary severance. Around 25 have secured future roles within the plant’s owner Uniper and elsewhere, says O’Grady. “We will be taking around 120 people into the decommissioning team, which has given people the confidence to stay with us through these final years, and we will continue to work with staff over the period of decommissioning to help them secure their futures,” he says.\nAside from coal-fired plants and mines, millions have been employed over the years in running the logistics chain, getting the fuel from domestic – or foreign – production facilities to the generators. With just 3m tonnes of coal last year entering the country by sea, from a record 51m tonnes in 2006, a spokesperson for Associated British Ports (ABP) – which owns the UK’s largest coal-import port, at Immingham in Lincolnshire – says the country’s terminals have had to adapt.\n“The UK’s ports have constantly evolved over the centuries [and] that remains the case today, with ABP’s ports having reduced the volumes of carbon-intensive commodities they handle now leading the way on enabling the supply chains for green products and services,” he says.\nYaxley reckons the UK perhaps missed some opportunities in the latter years of coal. “Ironically, I spent years and years banging on about security of supply and the risk of relying on global markets, sort of before it became fashionable. But now, of course, everybody’s suddenly aware of this.”\nHe questions the new Labour government’s energy strategy following the Conservative Party’s steady rule since 2010. “The new Labour government thinks the answer to security of supply is simply building loads and loads of renewables. But this doesn’t solve the problem of intermittency, and the failure to pursue carbon capture and storage technology, associated with coal, has been a major lost opportunity for the UK. This is what global leadership on climate change would have looked like.”\nTime to move onThere is a clear sense of nostalgia and some regret amongst former UK coal-industry workers. The world’s first coal-fired power station came online in London in 1882. Since then, coal powered the country through the final two decades of Queen Victoria’s reign, the roaring Twenties, the Blitz, the psychedelic 60s, the birth of the internet, the Spice Girls, and well into the new millennium. However, there is also an acceptance that the country no longer needs this fuel.\n“I view coal as having done its job [although] we’ve got to be very careful not to celebrate the loss of jobs and the economic deprivation that the loss of coal in some communities has caused,” says Heppenstall.  “But clearly there’s something going on with the climate and all responsible countries have got to take action. I think future generations will look back and thank us, whilst it’s painful now.”",

        "body": "\"Linking GOs to the physical electricity flow will result in fewer guarantees of origin being sold in Europe. The loss of income for the Norwegian state could amount to billions,” said Lars Ragnar Solberg of Afry, who has conducted the report on behalf of lobby group Renewables Norway.\nThe lobby group itself is a strong supporter of the GO market. The coalition government previously stated its intention to withdraw Norway – a non-EU nation – from the market, but the energy minister backpedalled in August. \nToday, Norwegian power producers can freely sell GOs from their renewable production to customers across the 27-nation EU bloc and the UK. The so-called linking solution, proposed by the Federation of Norwegian Industries, would not allow GO exports to exceed physical power exports.\nNorway sees revenues from GOs both from a resource-tax on power production and dividends from publicly owned power producers.\nIn a base scenario, where the current situation is maintained, Afry estimates that Norway will have revenues of nearly NOK 20bn from 2025 to 2029.\nIn a scenario with 30 TWh of power export from Norway, and corresponding GO volumes, revenues will be reduced by NOK 13bn over the same period, according to the analysis.\nIf the power balance is reduced so that Norway becomes a net importer of power, revenues will be reduced to almost zero.\nPrices could spikeIn the analysis, Afry said the loss of Norwegian GOs would lift European prices.\n“A linking solution will create a domestic and a foreign market for Norway. In the domestic market, GOs will be worth almost nothing, while the market in Europe will see a price spike. It will however not be enough to compensate for the loss of volumes,” said Solberg.\nThe analysis considers forward prices for GOs from July, which were then at EUR 2.20/MWh for 2025, EUR 2.40/MWh for 2026, and EUR 2.45/MWh for 2027. Afry has used the 2027 price as the basis for 2028 and 2029.\nIn the scenario with a volume of only 30 TWh from Norway, Afry expects a price increase of EUR 1.7/MWh on average in 2025-2029 in the European market.\nLobby conflictRenewables Norway has submitted Afry’s analysis to the country’s energy ministry and had a meeting with the ministry on 4 September where the scheme was discussed, Montel has learned.\nAt the same time, the Federation of Norwegian Industries is working to get the government on board with the transition to a linking scheme.\nSeveral industrial majors such as aluminium producer Norsk Hydro have criticised the scheme as they believe it enables greenwashing by competitors elsewhere. Manufacturers who use fossil fuels can claim a green profile by using GOs from Norwegian hydropower.\nIn addition, Norwegian industry does not want to have to pay to prove that the power it uses is free of carbon emissions like CO2. Renewables, predominantly hydropower, account for around 98% of Norway’s electricity generation.",

Additional interconnectors between Egypt and Greece, and Tunisia and Italy, will further boost Europe’s clean energy imports.\nWith these three initiatives, which represent about 7.2 GW of interconnector capacity, North Africa could deploy 23 GW of renewable capacity – 13.5 GW of solar and 9.5 GW of onshore wind – with an investment of USD 27.5bn, the report said.\n“Assuming all the power generated at these renewable facilities is dispatched to Europe, the three interconnections operating at maximum capacity could deliver about 55 TWh on an annual basis – translating to 1.6% of Europe’s overall power generation currently, and potentially replacing about 6% of Europe’s fossil-based power generation,” said Rystad.\nThat would align with the continent’s goal of reducing reliance on Russian natural gas, it added.\nSupply chain hurdlesCurrently, North Africa has solar and onshore wind installed capacity of more than 8 GW, while there are 350 GW of renewable energy projects at different stages of development.\nHowever, challenges such as supply chain constraints and financing hurdles may slow the deployment of these clean energy projects, according to the consultancy.\n“With limited local manufacturing capacity, the region must rely heavily on imports to meet its growing solar and wind energy demands,” it said, adding this reliance exposes North Africa to supply chain risks and price volatility.",

        "title": "Massive global growth of renewables to 2030 is set to match entire power capacity of major economies today, moving world closer to tripling goal",
        "subtitle": "With solar leading their rapid deployment, renewables are on course to meet almost half of global electricity demand by the end of this decade, new IEA report says",
        "body": "Due to supportive policies and favourable economics, the world’s renewable power capacity is expected to surge over the rest of this decade, with global additions on course to roughly equal the current power capacity of China, the European Union, India and the United States combined, according to a new IEA report out today.The Renewables 2024 report, the IEA’s flagship annual publication on the sector, finds that the world is set to add more than 5 500 gigawatts (GW) of new renewable energy capacity between 2024 and 2030 – almost three times the increase seen between 2017 and 2023.According to the report, China is set to account for almost 60% of all renewable capacity installed worldwide between now and 2030, based on current market trends and today's policy settings by governments. That would make China home to almost half of the world’s total renewable power capacity by the end of this decade, up from a share of a third in 2010. While China is adding the biggest volumes of renewables, India is growing at the fastest rate among major economies.In terms of technologies, solar PV alone is forecast to account for a massive 80% of the growth in global renewable capacity between now and 2030 – the result of the construction of new large solar power plants as well as an increase in rooftop solar installations by companies and households. And despite ongoing challenges, the wind sector is also poised for a recovery, with the rate of expansion doubling between 2024 and 2030, compared with the period between 2017 and 2023. Already, wind and solar PV are the cheapest options to add new electricity generation in almost every country.As a result of these trends, nearly 70 countries that collectively account for 80% of global renewable power capacity are poised to reach or surpass their current renewable ambitions for 2030. The growth is not fully in line with the goal set by nearly 200 governments at the COP28 climate change conference in December 2023 to triple the world’s renewable capacity this decade – the report forecasts global capacity will reach 2.7 times its 2022 level by 2030. But IEA analysis indicates that fully meeting the tripling target is entirely possible if governments take near-term opportunities for action. This includes outlining bold plans in the next round of Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement due next year, and bolstering international cooperation on bringing down high financing costs in emerging and developing economies, which are restraining renewables’ growth in high-potential regions such as Africa and Southeast Asia.“Renewables are moving faster than national governments can set targets for. This is mainly driven not just by efforts to lower emissions or boost energy security – it’s increasingly because renewables today offer the cheapest option to add new power plants in almost all countries around the world,” said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol. “This report shows that the growth of renewables, especially solar, will transform electricity systems across the globe this decade. Between now and 2030, the world is on course to add more than 5 500 gigawatts of renewable power capacity – roughly equal the current power capacity of China, the European Union, India and the United States combined. By 2030, we expect renewables to be meeting half of global electricity demand.”By the end of this decade, the share of wind and solar PV alone in global electricity generation is set to double to 30%, according to the forecast. However, the report emphasises the need for governments to ramp up their efforts to securely integrate these variable renewable sources into power systems. Recently, rates of curtailment – where renewable electricity generation isn’t put to use – have been increasing substantially, already reaching around 10% in several countries today. To address this, countries should focus on measures such as increasing power system flexibility. Making a concerted push to address policy uncertainties and streamline permitting processes – and to build and modernise 25 million kilometres of electricity grids and reach 1 500 GW of storage capacity by 2030, as highlighted in previous IEA analysis – would enable even larger shares of generation from renewables.Overall, led by the massive growth of renewable electricity, the share of renewables in final energy consumption is forecast to increase to nearly 20% by 2030, up from 13% in 2023. Meanwhile, renewable fuels – the subject of a special chapter in the report – are lagging behind, underscoring the need for dedicated policy support to decarbonise sectors that are hard to electrify.Meeting international climate goals would require not only accelerating the rollout of renewable power, but also significantly speeding up the adoption of sustainable biofuels, biogases, hydrogen and e-fuels, the report notes. Since these fuels remain more expensive than their fossil counterparts, their share in global energy is set to remain below 6% in 2030.The report also looks at the state of manufacturing for renewable technologies. Global solar manufacturing capacity is expected to surpass 1 100 GW by the end of 2024, more than double projected demand. While this supply glut, concentrated in China, has supported a decline in module prices – which have more than halved since early 2023 as a result – it also means that many manufacturers are seeing large financial losses.Given the growing international focus on industrial competitiveness, solar PV manufacturing capacity is forecast to triple in both India and the United States by 2030, helping global diversification. However, producing solar panels in the United States costs three times as much as in China, and in India, it is twice as expensive. According to the report, policymakers should consider how to strike a balance between the additional costs and benefits of local manufacturing, weighing key priorities such as job creation and energy security.",

        "subtitle": "",
        "body": "Nach einem schwachen Wochenstart ging es in der vergangenen KW 40 auch im weiteren Wochenverlauf weiter abwÃ¤rts fÃ¼r die Emissionszertifikate. Der EUA Dez.24-Future schloss mit einem Wochenverlust von 7,5 Prozent bei 61,46 Euro/t CO2. Das Wochenhoch wurde bei 66,97 Euro/t CO2 markiert, das Wochentief lag leicht unterhalb des Wochenschlusskurses bei 61,41 Euro/t CO2.Zum Start in die Handelswoche 41 setzte sich die SchwÃ¤che zunÃ¤chst fort. Am Montag erÃ¶ffnete der CO2-Dezember-Future bei 61,52 Euro/t CO2 und fiel bis auf 60,06 Euro/t CO2 zurÃ¼ck. Im weiteren Handelsverlauf meldeten sich die CO2-Bullen aber zurÃ¼ck, sodass der Dezember-Future 1,53 Prozent fester bei 62,40 Euro/t CO2 aus dem Handel ging. Am Dienstag Ã¼bernahmen die CO2-BÃ¤ren wieder das Handelszepter. Nach einem HÃ¶chstpreis bei 61,92 Euro/t CO2 fiel der Kurs im Tagestief bis auf 60,07 Euro/t CO2 zurÃ¼ck und schloss 3,56 Prozent leichter bei 60,18 Euro/t CO2. Auch am Mittwoch blieb zunÃ¤chst die 60-Euro-Marke im Fokus. Nach einem Low bei 59,95 Euro/t CO2 erholten sich die Preise aber und es ging auf Tagesschlusskursbasis 4,07 Prozent fester bei 62,63 Euro/t CO2 aus dem Handel. Die Hausse wird am Donnerstag fortgesetzt. Am Nachmittag gegen 14:30 Uhr notiert das CO2-Zertifikat 2,6 Prozent im Plus bei 64,26 Euro/t CO2.CO2-Shortpositionen steigen auf 6-MonatshochHintergrund des starken Preisanstiegs der EUAs dÃ¼rften insbesondere charttechnische Signale auf der 60-Euro-Marke gewesen sein. Angesichts der schwachen Wirtschaftsdaten blicken die spekulativen Marktteilnehmer derweil jedoch weiter pessimistisch auf den europÃ¤ischen Emissionshandel und haben ihre Netto-Short-Positionen auf 26,2 Mio. EUAs erhÃ¶ht, das hÃ¶chste Niveau seit Mitte MÃ¤rz. Dies entspricht einem Anstieg der Netto-Short-Position von 6,9 Mio. EUAs im Vergleich zur Vorwoche. Die Short-Positionen der spekulativen HÃ¤ndler stiegen um 3,2 Mio. EUAs auf 66,5 Mio. EUAs, wÃ¤hrend die Long-Positionen um 3,7 Mio. auf 40,3 Mio. EUAs abgebaut wurden. Dies ging einher mit einem Wochenverlust des Dez. 24-Futures von 7,5 Prozent in der KW 40.UBA untersucht Krisenfestigkeit des EU-ETSIn einem Rechtsgutachten hat das Umweltbundesamt (UBA) die Krisenfestigkeit des europÃ¤ischen Emissionshandels (EU-ETS) untersucht. Aktuelle Krisen wie der Krieg in der Ukraine und die Corona-Pandemie stellen das EU-ETS vor erhebliche Herausforderungen, besonders bei der Umsetzung der Verpflichtung zur Abgabe von Emissionszertifikaten. Eine Untersuchung der aktuellen Gesetzeslage auf EU- und nationaler Ebene zeigt einen deutlichen Bedarf an Anpassungen, insbesondere im Umgang mit Krisensituationen wie hÃ¶herer Gewalt, Insolvenzen oder Betriebsstilllegungen. Verbesserungen sollten sich auf klarere Regelungen und das SchlieÃ?en von LÃ¼cken konzentrieren, wobei die Zusammenarbeit zwischen EU- und nationalen BehÃ¶rden zentral ist. Statt eines reinen MaÃ?nahmenkatalogs wird der Einsatz von Verwaltungsinstrumenten, wie etwa die Sperrung von Zertifikatkonten, als sinnvoll erachtet. So soll den BehÃ¶rden mehr Spielraum gegeben werden, um die Abgabeverpflichtungen auch in Krisenzeiten sicherzustellen. Derzeit dÃ¼rfen insolvenzgefÃ¤hrdete Unternehmen ihre Zertifikate verkaufen, ohne zuvor ihre Emissionsverpflichtungen des Vorjahres zu erfÃ¼llen. Dieses Vorgehen fÃ¼hrt zu einem Ã?berangebot an Zertifikaten, was die Preise belastet. Das UBA empfiehlt daher, nationalen Regierungen zu gestatten, Unternehmen daran zu hindern, Zertifikate zu verkaufen, bevor ihre Emissionen des Vorjahres gedeckt sind.Autor: Tobias Waniek von enerchaseÂ ",

Die 60-Euro-Marke hielt jedoch als wichtige UnterstÃ¼tzung, woraufhin es bereits am Mittwochnachmittag wieder aufwÃ¤rtsging. Der Kaufdruck setzte sich am Donnerstag fort, und die Preise markierten mit 65,21 Euro/t CO2 das Wochenhoch. Nach einem ruhigen Freitagshandel schloss die Woche mit einem Plus von 5,6 Prozent bei 64,88 Euro/t CO2.Der positive Schwung hielt zu Beginn der KW 42 an, und am Montag verzeichneten die EUAs erneut einen Anstieg. Der Kurs erreichte ein Tageshoch von 66,18 Euro/t CO2 und schloss mit einem Plus von 1,7 Prozent bei 65,95 Euro/t CO2. Am Dienstag fiel der Preis intraday auf ein Tief von 64,17 Euro/t CO2, bevor ein Teil der Verluste wieder egalisiert wurde. Die CO2-Zertifikate schlossen um 1,0 Prozent leichter bei 65,28 Euro/t CO2. Am Mittwoch kam es zu einem stÃ¤rkeren KursrÃ¼ckgang. Nachdem der Kurs ein Tageshoch von 65,63 Euro/t CO2 erreicht hatte, fiel er auf ein Tagestief von 62,80 Euro/t CO2. Der Handel endete mit einem Schlusskurs von 63,17 Euro/t CO2, was einem Minus von 3,23 Prozent entsprach. Am Donnerstagnachmittag zeigen sich die BÃ¤ren etwas stÃ¤rker. Nach einer Trading-Range zwischen 63,64 Euro/t CO2 auf der Ober- und 62,82 Euro/t CO2 auf der Unterseite notiert der EUA Dezember-Future um 15 Uhr mit einem Minus von 0,4 Prozent bei 62,90 Euro/t CO2.Hohes Kaufinteresse auf 60-Euro-MarkeDie aktuellen Daten des CoT-Reports der ICE Endex-BÃ¶rse zeigen, dass spekulative Marktteilnehmer ihre Netto-Short-Positionen fÃ¼r CO2 in der letzten Woche leicht reduzierten. Diese blieben jedoch nahe einem Sechs-Monatshoch. Die Netto-Short-Position betrug am vergangenen Freitag 24,1 Mio. EUAs, ein RÃ¼ckgang um 2,2 Mio. EUAs gegenÃ¼ber der Vorwoche. Insbesondere die Long-Positionen wurden aufgestockt und erhÃ¶hten sich um 2 Mio. EUAs auf 41,6 Mio. EUAs, wÃ¤hrend die Short-Positionen leicht um 0,2 Mio. EUAs auf 65,7 Mio. EUAs sanken.Der dynamische Kursprung auf der 60-Euro-Marke von letzter Woche kann damit erklÃ¤rt werden. Mit Blick auf den Wochen-Candlestick-Chart kann in der letzten Handelswoche zudem ein hohes Handelsvolumen beobachtet werden, was auf reges Kaufinteresse hindeutet. Die vorherige Abfolge hoher Handelsvolumina in Wochen mit fallenden Preisen ist somit beendet. Die KW 41 stellt sogar eine Handelswoche mit dem vierthÃ¶chsten Volumen des Jahres dar. Auf der 60-Euro-Marke zeigte sich somit eine hohe Kaufbereitschaft, weshalb diese Marke auch kÃ¼nftig von besonderem Interesse bleiben dÃ¼rfte, sollte sie nochmals angelaufen werden. Hier besteht kÃ¼nftig ein starker Support.PrimÃ¤rmarktauktion zeigt SchwÃ¤cheDie PrimÃ¤rmarktauktion an der EEX erreichte am Montag 65 Euro/t CO2 (Cover Ratio: 1,86), nachdem der Auktionspreis am Freitag zuvor noch bei 63,71 Euro/t CO2 lag.

        "subtitle": "(Montel) A cold reality awaits European efforts to decarbonise heating and transport, sectors whose emissions have remained stubbornly high but will soon receive their own carbon trading scheme.",
        "body": "A statue to Ludwig van Beethoven, perhaps Bonn’s most renowned son, gazes down sternly on a sprawling tent, lit up in green. The former German capital’s municipal utility spent the second week of October reaching out to the public at the city’s Muensterplatz. It’s a blowy and cool end to what has been a cold and wet week. The weather is turning, but it’s not the encroaching winter that still grabs attention two years after Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine set off Germany’s rapid loss of Russian gas. The focus of the evening is how Bonn will heat in future – a future without emissions. \nThe Green party mayor aims to decarbonise the city by 2035. She is joined by the head of Stadtwerke Bonn, who is there to explain how his utility could do it. Also on stage is a pricklier interlocutor. The conservative head of the surrounding district trades veiled barbs with his metropolitan counterpart. Offstage he is more forthright. “It’s not going to happen.”\nOver a high table, away from the crowds, Olaf Hermes lays out the challenge for his utility. “We have two large sources of emissions,” he says, “our waste utilisation plant first and – with a similar volume of emissions – our gas-fired power plant.” Both provide heat as well as electricity. Decarbonising them would cut the city’s emissions by around 60%, Hermes says. The rest could be cut by electrifying Bonn’s 200 diesel buses and encouraging those homes not suitable for district heating to replace household gas- or oil-burners with electric heat pumps, he adds. His challenge is typical of the one confronting the German energy sector. Last year, gas still heated almost half of Germans’ homes, according to BDEW energy industry association figures. Oil heated roughly another quarter. \nHKW Nord Bonn gas plant. Source: SWB/Benjamin Westhoff\nThe federal government hopes to change this successively. A law came into effect this year that gradually obliges new heating systems to meet at least 65% of their energy with renewable sources. The bill will soon be flanked at the European level by another layer of obligations intended to penalise fossil fuels: the EU’s second emissions trading scheme, the ETS 2. From next year, upstream fuel suppliers for heating and transport must report their emissions. From 2027, they will be obliged to buy and surrender allowances to cover their pollution under a cap-and-trade scheme. This will be separate from the EU’s first carbon trading scheme that has come to encompass power, industry, aviation and shipping since its launch in 2005. That got off to a rocky start. Despite its prominence as the EU’s flagship policy to cut emissions, the first carbon market needed 13 years of tinkering to become relevant in the power sector. The European Commission is confident it has learned its lessons – but there has always been a tension between the carbon market and overlapping national policies that affect its demand.  \nPricing in emissionsTrevor Sikorski, head of natural gas and emissions at consultancy Energy Aspects, is bullish on both carbon markets. He expects the new one to hit EUR 100/t swiftly, despite an envisioned soft ceiling of EUR 45/t at its launch. That would take prices to the record highs seen on ETS 1 in early 2023 – roughly 66% above what its allowances presently fetch. “The sectors in ETS 2 mostly have as their main decarbonisation pathways something to do with power,” says Sikorski. The most efficient technologies to decarbonise transport and buildings are respectively electric propulsion and heat pumps, he adds. “So every time you reduce emissions in ETS 2, you’re lumping them into the power sector, which is covered by ETS 1.” \nAt the same time, the pace of decarbonisation is likely to struggle to keep up with the declining availability of allowances to emit. The EU aims to be carbon neutral by mid-century while Germany is targeting 2045. From roughly 1 billion tonnes upon introduction, the scheme’s cumulative emissions will need to vanish by the early 2040s. “Particularly from about 2029 onwards, caps are probably going to fall faster than emissions,” Sikorski says. \nNorway-based consultancy Veyt even expects ETS 2 prices to surpass EUR 200/t by the end of this decade. A so-called frontloading mechanism will inflate supply by around 30% in the system’s first year to help smooth its start. But this will come at the expense of sales otherwise slated for 2029-2031. Market tightness will produce a “rapid and steep rise” in prices, says Veyt’s EU carbon analysis manager Ingvild Sorhus. “Very soon, at least based on [European] national policies and climate plans, we are with emission trajectories that are getting into a short system.” This means prices on the scheme will have to hit levels that either destroy demand or surpass the cost of investing in clean alternatives. By Veyt’s estimates, this could add up to EUR 0.50 per litre to the price of diesel – an increase of between a third and a quarter of the typical cost of refuelling a car in Europe this year. \nPrices on the EU’s emissions trading scheme have surged since a reform to tighten the availability of supply became operational in 2019. Source: Montel/Ice Endex\nToo much burden?Such thorny effects – though a market signal – could also see the scheme derailed, say others. “If we are still in a period of either recession or an extended period of slow growth for the EU, I could quite easily see it being watered down or delayed – or both,” says Tom Lord, head of trading at UK consultancy Redshaw Advisors. Mark Lewis, head of climate research at Andurand Capital, is blunter. “If you liked the politics of ETS 1, you’re going to love the politics of ETS 2.” He sees the backlash of such burdens reviving protests like the yellow vests movement that rocked France from late 2018 to the summer of 2020. Sparked by rising energy prices, protests at a worsening cost of living swiftly transformed into a broader challenge to the authority of the French state and were met with a brutal police response. “It’s going to be the Gilets Jaunes all over again.”\nYet higher carbon prices are at least one part of what utilities across Europe will need to make viable the investments that decarbonise their assets. Stadtwerke Bonn plans to capture the carbon emissions of its waste utilisation plant to inject into a future grid for CO2. The average cost of capturing, transporting and storing carbon dioxide across European projects comes to around EUR 180/t, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. The utility’s plan for its other major asset, the natural gas-fired plant, is to replace its fuel incrementally with clean-burning hydrogen – first blending in 15% and eventually growing the share to 100%. This aligns with the federal government’s ambitions for Germany more broadly. \nBerlin hopes to back up the renewable energy it is steadily growing for power generation with a suite of flexible options including batteries, interconnections, and more responsive demand. Where natural gas-fired plants remain an indispensable part of that mix, their fuel should be replaced with hydrogen, developed with clean power and which emits only water. Germany plans to start tendering soon for a 10 GW fleet of hydrogen-ready power plants that could begin entering service from 2030. Yet a string of cancelled projects in recent weeks suggests this vision is in for a reality check.\nGreat expectations Shell, Equinor and Orsted have all scrapped large proposals to develop hydrogen production facilities, citing concerns about costs and demand. “They’re not going ahead because they don’t meet the economic expectations of the people that pitched them in the first place,” says David Cebon, a professor of mechanical engineering at Cambridge University and a founder of the Hydrogen Science Coalition. “It’s all based on unrealistic expectations for what hydrogen is going to do.” The physical properties of hydrogen and the laws of thermodynamics mean using it as an energy carrier will always require prices three times more expensive than the electricity that went into making it in the first place, Cebon says. This is a consequence of the unavoidable efficiency losses associated with its production. “It is very, very expensive to use that hydrogen to create electricity because you’ve thrown away two thirds of what you generated in order to do it,” he says. “It’s much cheaper to electrify in the long term.” \nThe most viable deployment of clean hydrogen will be to replace conventional hydrogen – won through fossil fuels – in its existing, non-energy applications, Cebon says. These include fertilisers and certain petrochemical processes, like for making glass. “Just to make those out of green hydrogen is something like two-to-three times all the renewables that we have on the planet at the moment,” he says. “That’s a big job in its own right, before you start talking about things like powering trucks or making e-fuels or heating homes.”\nA statue of composer Ludwig van Beethoven in Bonn, North Rhine Westphalia, Germany. Source: PhotoFires/Shutterstock.com\nBack in Bonn, Hermes is keeping his options open. He has spent EUR 90m on upgrading his assets, including EUR 60m in federal support for combined heat and power plants. But only EUR 1m has so far gone towards converting his gas plant to accept hydrogen. “We would only switch once hydrogen is available and in such a way that it is affordable for customers. If it is not affordable, or available, we will stick with natural gas.” Ultimately, the city’s ability to decarbonise will rest on the requisite networks beyond his control – whether for hydrogen as a fuel, or carbon dioxide as a waste product, he adds. “There must be a CO2 grid in Germany for residual fossil generation structures – and they will continue to exist.” For now, the company faces the challenge posed by the emissions costs confronting its current assets. “Here I assume prices could well increase six to sevenfold.”",

Based on today’s policy settings, Southeast Asia is on course to account for 25% of global energy demand growth between now and 2035, second only to India over the period and more than double the region’s share of growth since 2010. By mid-century, energy demand in Southeast Asia overtakes that of the European Union.Growth is led by the electricity sector. Electricity demand in Southeast Asia is set to surge at an annual rate of 4%, the report projects, with growing use of air conditioning amid more frequent heatwaves a big driver of increased electricity consumption. According to the report, clean energy sources such as wind and solar, alongside modern bioenergy and geothermal, are projected to meet more than a third of the growth in energy demand in the region by 2035. This is a step up compared with the past but not enough to rein in the region’s energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, which are set to increase by 35% between now and mid-century. To turn this around, a major push is required to align with the outcomes of the COP28 climate change conference and meet the national goals that have been set in the region, all of which would mean halving today’s emissions by 2050, the report finds. Today, of the 10 member economies of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which are among the world’s fastest growing, eight have net zero emissions goals. “Southeast Asia is one of the most economically dynamic regions of the world and is set to account for a quarter of the growth in global energy demand over the next decade as its population, prosperity and industries expand,” said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol. “Countries in the region have a diverse mix of energy sources including highly competitive renewables. But clean energy technologies are not expanding quickly enough and the continued heavy reliance on fossil fuel imports is leaving countries highly exposed to future risks. Southeast Asia has made great progress on issues such as energy access, clean cooking and developing clean energy manufacturing, but now it must ramp up efforts to deploy those technologies at home. Access to finance and investment for the region’s fast-growing economies will play a pivotal role in strengthening their energy security and delivering on their emissions reduction goals.” Scaling up clean energy investments is crucial for Southeast Asia to reduce emissions, the report highlights. As of today, the region as a whole attracts only 2% of global clean energy investment despite accounting for 6% of global GDP, 5% of global energy demand and being home to 9% of the world’s population. The current level of investment will require a fivefold increase – with $190 billion needed in 2035 – to put the region on a pathway consistent with achieving its announced energy and climate goals. Scaling up clean energy investment needs to be accompanied by strategies to reduce emissions from the region’s relatively young fleet of coal-fired plants, which are less than 15 years old on average.In addition to deploying technologies such as wind and solar, a build out of associated infrastructure is essential to ensure secure and flexible electricity systems. Expanding and modernising the region’s power grids to support greater shares of variable renewable energy will require annual investment in this space to double to nearly $30 billion by 2035, according to the report. This includes regional cooperation initiatives such as the ASEAN Power Grid as well renewables-based microgrids to serve islands and communities in remote areas.The report highlights how the benefits of accelerating clean energy transitions have already been felt across Southeast Asia, with over 85,000 jobs created since 2019, and further potential to expand clean energy technology manufacturing and critical minerals processing across the region. For example, Indonesia, with its vast reserves of nickel, is a major producer of lithium-ion batteries and components.  Viet Nam, Thailand and Malaysia are the largest manufacturers of solar PV systems after China. And Singapore, the world’s largest bunkering port, can play a critical role in efforts to reduce emissions from shipping through fuels such as ammonia and methanol. International cooperation, through organisations such as ASEAN, will be essential to move forward on secure, people-centred clean energy transitions at a time of escalating geopolitical tensions and growing climate risks. The IEA stands ready to support countries in Southeast Asia in their efforts to reach these goals. The opening of the IEA’s new office in Singapore – the first IEA office outside the Agency’s Paris headquarters in its 50-year history – is a concrete example of the IEA’s deepening engagement with countries across Southeast Asia and beyond to enhance energy security and accelerate clean energy transitions.",

        "subtitle": "(Montel) EUAs could hover close to EUR 50/t until 2027, despite wider expectations that long-term emissions reduction obligations will push prices up, said SEB bank on Tuesday.",
        "body": "It was “highly feasible” that EUAs will trade at EUR 50-55/t over the next two years due to what amounted to a comfortable volume of inventory, a new report from the Nordic financial group said.\nThe EU ETS “looks like it has a very wide degree of freedom for the EUA price to move around and along such a price path … in the short-term, medium-term or the long-term”, said SEB’s chief commodities analyst Bjarne Schieldrop.\nThe benchmark Dec 24 contract was last seen trading at EUR 62.14/t. It has shed 23% since the start of the year and remains well below the EUR 101/t it hit in early 2023.\nSufficient inventoryThe global oil market typically holds around 50 days of forward demand in inventory, Schieldrop said.\nIn contrast, the carbon market effectively holds around 373 days of forward demand in inventory expressed in the total number of allowances in circulation (TNAC), the amount of EUAs issued net those required for compliance purposes.\nThis rendered the carbon market “partially unhinged” from the prevailing balance of supply and demand. This also led to factors such as technical trading, the cost of natural gas, and speculation on assumptions of distant supply shortages becoming bigger price drivers than short-term fluctuations in demand, Schieldrop added. \n“At the end of 2023 the TNAC stood at 1,112m EUAs versus emissions of 1,087 [million tonnes] that year,” he said. “That is a 7.5 times larger inventory than in the oil market.”\nSupply squeeze?SEB’s EUA outlook contrasted sharply with that of Oslo-based consultancy Veyt, which expects European carbon prices to double by 2026 and to triple from present levels by 2035.\nThe Market Stability Reserve, which controls how much of the TNAC is available, would work at an “accelerated pace” to account for the additional volumes of EUAs put on the market from 2023-26 to finance the RePowerEU programme.\n“Responsibility to ensure emissions fall below an ever-shrinking cap will increasingly fall on the shoulders of industry, whose abatement costs will become a price-setting factor for EUAs,” Veyt said.\nThe consultancy expects prices to rise to EUR 160/t by 2027.\n“Current prices fail to fully reflect the tough dilemma emitters will face: competing for a shrinking pool of EUAs, implementing costly abatement technology, or scaling down production,” it said.",

        "body": "Nach einer festeren ErÃ¶ffnung der Handelswoche 42 zeigten sich die CO2-Zertifikate in der zweiten WochenhÃ¤lfte schwÃ¤cher. Der EUA Dezember 2024-Future schloss am Freitag mit einem Wochenverlust von 3,5 Prozent bei 62,62 Euro/t CO2. Das Wochenhoch lag bei 66,18 Euro/t CO2, das Wochentief bei 62,22 Euro/t CO2.Zu Beginn der Handelswoche 43 setzte sich die AbwÃ¤rtsbewegung am Montag fort. Der CO2-Preis fiel auf ein Tagestief von 61,36 Euro/t CO2, erholte sich jedoch leicht und schloss mit einem Minus von 1,2 Prozent bei 61,90 Euro/t CO2. Am Dienstag stabilisierten sich die Preise. Nach einem Handel zwischen 62,56 Euro/t CO2 im Tageshoch und 61,29 Euro/t CO2 im Tagestief schloss der EUA-Future 0,7 Prozent fester bei 62,31 Euro/t CO2. Am Mittwoch kam es zu einem deutlichen Kursanstieg. Der CO2-Dezember-Future erreichte ein Tageshoch von 65,36 Euro/t CO2 und schloss mit einem Plus von 4,6 Prozent bei 65,15 Euro/t CO2. Dabei zeigte sich ein hohes Handelsvolumen von 30.499 Kontrakten. Auch am Donnerstag setzten die EUAs ihren Anstieg fort. Das bisherige Tageshoch von 66,50 Euro/t CO2 konnte jedoch nicht gehalten werden, und gegen 13:30 Uhr lag der Kurs bei 65,60 Euro/t CO2 (plus 0,7 Prozent).Bemerkenswerte CO2-PreisprognosenLaut einem Bericht der SEB-Bank kÃ¶nnten die Preise fÃ¼r EU-Emissionszertifikate (EUAs) in den nÃ¤chsten zwei Jahren im Bereich von 50-55 Euro/t CO2 bleiben. Ein komfortabler Ã?berschuss an Zertifikaten stÃ¼tzt diese PreisstabilitÃ¤t. Die Gesamtmenge der im Umlauf befindlichen Zertifikate (TNAC) ist groÃ?, wÃ¤hrend die zusÃ¤tzlichen Emissionen im Vergleich dazu gering sind. Dieser Preispfad hÃ¤tte zudem laut der Analyse nur geringe Auswirkungen auf die modellierten Preise in den spÃ¤teren Jahren. Zudem haben die Modellberechnungen ergeben, dass auch ein Preisniveau von 60 Euro/t CO2 bis 2030 mÃ¶glich wÃ¤re, ohne dass das EU-ETS in eine kritische Engpasssituation kommen wÃ¼rde. Dies basiert auf der Annahme, dass es zu diesem Zeitpunkt kaum noch Emissionen im Stromsektor gibt. Die Emissionsvermeidung findet dann Ã¼berwiegend in den Nicht-Stromsektoren statt.Eine weitere Analyse von der Beraterfirma Veyt geht hingegen davon aus, dass sich die Preise bis 2026 verdoppeln und bis 2035 verdreifachen kÃ¶nnten. Auch eine Analyse von LSEG geht von steigenden CO2-Preisen ab 2026 aus. Zudem wird der europÃ¤ische CO2-Markt in den Jahren 2025, 2026 und 2027 stÃ¤rkeren VerÃ¤nderungen unterliegen. FÃ¼r 2025 wird erwartet, dass der Markt aufgrund eines Ã?berangebots an Zertifikaten und einer geringen Nachfrage preislich unter Druck bleibt. Die Spekulanten werden weiterhin eine dominierende Rolle spielen und algorithmische Handelsstrategien verfolgen. Ab 2026 soll der CO2-Markt laut LSEG knapper werden, da weniger CO2-Zertifikate versteigert und die freien Zuteilungen fÃ¼r die Industrie reduziert werden. Insbesondere die Luftfahrt wird bis 2026 keine kostenlosen Zuteilungen mehr erhalten, wÃ¤hrend auch die Schifffahrt stÃ¤rker in den Emissionshandel einbezogen wird.PrimÃ¤rmarktauktion steigt in Richtung 65 Euro/t CO2Die PrimÃ¤rmarktauktion an der EEX erreichte am Montag 62,30 Euro/t CO2 (Cover Ratio: 1,59), nach einem Auktionspreis von 61,90 Euro/t CO2 am Freitag. Am Dienstag sank der Auktionspreis auf 61,22 Euro/t CO2 (Cover Ratio: 1,60). Im Einklang mit dem festeren SekundÃ¤rmarkt stiegen auch die Preise am PrimÃ¤rmarkt. Am Mittwoch betrug der Auktionspreis 63,75 Euro/t CO2 (Cover Ratio: 1,75), und am Donnerstag stieg der Preis weiter auf 64,60 Euro/t CO2 (Cover Ratio: 1,57).Autor: Tobias Waniek von enerchaseâ?",

        "body": "Last Wednesday, Statkraft said it was divesting its renewable activities in the Netherlands and Croatia to focus on fewer markets amid a management reshuffle.\n“The background for Wednesday’s announcement is that Statkraft has more profitable renewable energy projects in the portfolio than our investment capacity allows us to finalise,” said Lars Magnus Gunther, a spokesman for Statkraft.\nCroatia’s renewable energy market is still at an early stage of development with growth potential in solar and wind, Gunther said. But high upfront costs for grid connection was making it “difficult for Statkraft to progress the pipeline”, he added.\nCroatian energy regulator Hera was supposed to adopt the grid connection fee over two years ago, with developers repeatedly warning that without it, they could not calculate the total cost of their projects.\nStatkraft’s announcement was somewhat unexpected after opening a new office in Croatia’s capital, Zagreb, last month. Neoen, a French renewables developer, became the first to exit Croatia this year when it sold its pipeline of Croatian projects to Statkraft.\nAt the time, the company had as much as 750 MW of solar projects in its portfolio in various phases of development, with 110 MW of those set to be operational by 2027.\nStatkraft’s Croatian subsidiary told Montel that in the near term, the company will continue to mature the projects in the portfolio while seeking new owners for its business in Croatia.\nOthers to follow suit?Several other foreign companies might also be considering a similar move as the country’s renewable energy sector has been largely stagnant with a very uncertain future, according to Aljosa Pleic, vice president of the renewables association in the country’s chamber of commerce (HGK).\nThe very slow permitting process in recent years has led to a situation where projects in development often lose one permit while waiting for another, he said.",

        "body": "“The first inquiries came in in 2022 and we saw a sharp increase in 2024,” said Joana Niggemann, spokeswoman for the country’s southwestern TSO Amprion.\n“Since 2023, we can speak of a real boom, which intensified even further in 2024,” said Kathrin Egger, spokeswoman of southern TSO Transnet.\nVolker Gustedt, spokesman for east German TSO 50Hertz, also spoke of a “boom”, adding: “New enquiries are coming in almost every day.”\nCurrently, large-scale battery storage systems with a capacity of 1.4 GW are installed in Germany, according to data from Aachen University.\nHowever, not all of these requested new capacities could be connected to the grid due to technical restrictions, said the TSOs.\nAmprion could technically connect 70-80% of the requested 36 GW capacity in its balancing zone, said Niggemann.\n“For most requests, it is too early to say whether they will actually be built,” said Egger.\nIn addition to TSO grids, batteries can be connected to the country’s nearly 900 distribution grid networks, which may boost the number of successful projects.\nRenewable buildoutThe increase in connection requests has come amid strong renewable buildout and fossil fuel phase-out, which has increased volatility in the power market. This has improved the business case for battery storage to stabilise the grid and store production surplus for times of low renewable output.\nTo date this year, there have already been 440 hours with negative prices in the country’s day-ahead auction, with sometimes massive price deviations between the cheapest and the most expensive hours on a given day and an average price difference of roughly EUR 117/MWh on Epex Spot.\nGermany aims for renewables to reach an 80% share in the power mix by 2030, which includes the plan to more than double current solar capacities to 215 GW.",

        "body": "Italy and the UK combined would make up 50% of the continent’s capacity by the turn of the decade, Matteo Coriglioni, Aurora’s head of Italy, told Montel’s first Italian Energy Day in Milan.\nKey emerging markets including Greece, Spain and Portugal should also see significant growth, driven by established targets, he added.\nUsing batteries to store energy is seen by market participants as key to improving power system flexibility and dampening high volatility in short-term markets caused by a rapidly increasing share of intermittent renewables. The EU has a binding target to source 42.5% of its energy from renewables by 2030.\nIn Italy, full achievement of national targets would see utility-scale battery capacity grow seven-fold to 58 GWh by 2030, from 8 GWh currently, with most of the potential seen in southern Italy, Sicily and Sardinia, Coriglioni added.\nDiversified revenuesHowever, Italy’s TSO Terna recently revised down its target for new grid-scale storage capacity from 71 GWh to 50 GWh by 2030.\nItalian investors in batteries would receive income from price volatility in wholesale and ancillary markets, but also from multi-year contracts in the country’s capacity market, Coriglioni said.\nLast year, Terna announced a new mechanism called Macse, to subsidise utility-scale storage investments through competitive auctions but it has not yet defined and scheduled the tenders.\nA combination of revenues from the Macse scheme and merchant trading would be the most profitable scenario, yet price fluctuations in wholesale markets also posed risks, Coriglioni added.\nBattery project developers in European countries must typically navigate between different day-ahead, intraday and ancillary markets, as well as capacity schemes, Montel reported last month.\nMacse the “main path”A safer bet would be the full participation in the Macse scheme, as it offered stable and predictable revenues while mitigating market risks, several participants at the event said. Payments in the scheme are fixed for 15 years, with partial adjustments for annual inflation.\n“We see Macse as the main path,” said Salvatore Casa, partner at consultancy firm Elemens.\n“A mechanism that stabilises revenues is needed to guide investments,” agreed Giorgio Perico from MBS Consulting.\nHowever, crucial details such as auction schedules, remuneration and volumes were still lacking, he added.",

Dabei setzte sich die positive Entwicklung vom Mittwoch am Donnerstag weiter fort, und der EUA Dezember-Future schloss den Handelstag 2,3 Prozent fester bei 66,63 Euro/t CO2. Am Freitag konnte sich dann keine Marktpartei mehr klar durchsetzen.Am Montag der Handelswoche 44 fiel das CO2-Zertifikat intraday auf ein Tagestief von 64,61 Euro/t CO2. Die CO2-Bullen konnten die Verluste jedoch auf ein Minus von 0,4 Prozent begrenzen, der Schlusskurs lag bei 66,50 Euro/t CO2. Auch am Dienstag blieb der Handel mit CO2-Zertifikaten volatil. Nach einem Handel zwischen 67,75 Euro/t CO2 im Tageshoch und 66,14 Euro/t CO2 im Tagestief schloss das Verschmutzungsrecht mit einem Plus von 0,5 Prozent bei 66,85 Euro/t CO2. Am Mittwoch Ã¼bernahmen dann die CO2-BÃ¤ren das Handelszepter, was zu einem RÃ¼ckgang von 1,6 Prozent auf 65,77 Euro/t CO2 fÃ¼hrte. Die SchwÃ¤che setzt sich am Donnerstag weiter fort. Die EUAs notieren gegen 14:30 Uhr 1,5 Prozent leichter bei 64,81 Euro/t CO2.Trotz der Verluste bleibt jedoch festzuhalten, dass der kurzfristige AufwÃ¤rtstrend intakt ist und die aktuelle KursschwÃ¤che nur eine Korrektur nach der AufwÃ¤rtsbewegung darstellen kÃ¶nnte. Die BÃ¤ren mÃ¼ssen aus charttechnischer Sicht noch erhebliche Arbeit leisten, um wieder die Oberhand zu gewinnen.Netto-Short-Position im EU-ETS rÃ¼cklÃ¤ufigEin Blick auf die Positionierung der spekulativen Marktteilnehmer zeigt, dass es fÃ¼r die BÃ¤ren nicht so einfach wird, sich nachhaltig durchzusetzen. In der vergangenen Woche reduzierten spekulative Investoren ihre Netto-Short-Positionen im CO2-Markt deutlich um 9 Mio. EUAs auf 15,1 Mio. EUAs, den niedrigsten Stand seit Anfang September. Laut CoT-Report sank die Gesamtmenge der Short-Positionen um 8,3 Mio. EUAs auf 56,5 Mio. EUAs, wÃ¤hrend die Long-Positionen weitgehend stabil bei rund 41,4 Mio. EUAs blieben (plus 942.000 EUAs). Wie eingangs beschrieben, profitierte der Preis des EUA Dezember 24-Kontrakts in der vergangenen Woche von der SchlieÃ?ung der Short-Positionen und erzielte einen Wochengewinn von 6,6 Prozent. Es bleibt abzuwarten, ob die Investoren von einer Netto-Short- zu einer Netto-Long-Position wechseln wollen, was ein stark bullishes Signal wÃ¤re. VorlÃ¤ufig kÃ¶nnten es auch lediglich Gewinnmitnahmen und eine Reduzierung offener Positionen sein, wodurch auch das Risiko eines â??Short-Squeezeâ?? weiter sinkt.Deutscher Energieverbrauch sinkt auf RekordtiefDie Nachfrage nach CO2-Zertifikaten bleibt angesichts der schwachen Konjunktur eingetrÃ¼bt. Die Industrie zeigt weiterhin wenig positive Signale: Der Automobilkonzern VW verzeichnete im dritten Quartal einen starken Gewinneinbruch von 64 Prozent auf rund 1,6 Mrd. Euro. Auch der Chemiekonzern BASF rechnet im wichtigen AutogeschÃ¤ft mit einem schwachen vierten Quartal, da fast 20 Prozent seines Umsatzes mit der Autoindustrie zusammenhÃ¤ngen. â??Die Vorzeichen fÃ¼r die Automobilindustrie sind momentan insgesamt nicht positivâ??, erklÃ¤rte Vorstandschef Markus Kamieth. Angesichts dieser Entwicklungen dÃ¼rfte der Energieverbrauch in Deutschland in diesem Jahr ein neues Rekordtief erreichen. Laut einer ersten Prognose der Arbeitsgemeinschaft Energiebilanzen wird ein RÃ¼ckgang um 1,7 Prozent im Vergleich zum Vorjahr erwartet, wodurch der Verbrauch fast 30 Prozent unter dem bisherigen HÃ¶chststand von 1990 liegt.

        "title": "Clean energy transitions continue to accelerate, but progress is uneven",
        "subtitle": "IEA’s latest monitor shows wide variations in clean energy deployment among regions and technologies amid increased manufacturing capacity and declining costs",
        "body": "Despite concerns about setbacks in the global deployment of clean energy technologies, the latest data points to continued growth, according to a new update from the IEA. The report notes, however, that progress is uneven across different regions and technologies, highlighting the need for more supportive policies to enable countries to navigate the transition.The latest edition of the IEA’s Clean Energy Market Monitor, which provides timely tracking of clean energy deployment for a select group of technologies and outlines the implications for energy markets more broadly, covers the first half of 2024. The report shows that solar PV continues to lead clean technology deployment, with new additions up 36% from the first half of 2023, and 80% in the United States alone. Electric vehicle sales increased by 25% while new wind power capacity kept pace with the record additions seen in 2023. However, heat pump sales saw a notable decline of 10% at the global level, driven by lower sales in Europe, while those in China, the United States and Japan remained strong.Around 7 million electric cars were sold worldwide in the first half of 2024. In China, electric vehicles made up nearly 45% of China’s total car sales in the first half of the year, and the number crossed 50% in more recent months. There are also signs that clean energy transitions are accelerating in other emerging market and developing economies. Sales of electric vehicles in these markets doubled compared with the same period in 2023. Additions of solar PV capacity in India increased by 90% the first six months of this year, and by more than 30% in China over the same period. By contrast, some clean energy technologies hit hurdles in some European countries in the first half of the year. Heat pumps sales in Europe fell by almost 50% and electric car sales grew by only 3% compared with the same period in 2023. A significant drop in Germany meant that overall EV sales growth in Europe was flat despite strong growth in the United Kingdom, Belgium and the Netherlands.After an uptick in the post-pandemic period, clean energy equipment costs have resumed their downward trend. The IEA’s Clean Energy Equipment Price Index now tracks price developments for key clean energy technologies on a quarterly basis and shows that in the first half of 2024 alone, solar PV prices have dropped by 20%, grid-scale battery storage prices decreased by almost 10% while equipment prices for wind turbines have dropped by 5% over the last year.  The rapid rollout of solar PV in China in the first half of 2024 was helped by a fall in module prices, which have more than halved in the last year. This has also had positive knock-on effects for household and commercial customers using distributed solar systems, allowing them to save on their electricity bills. While falling clean energy equipment prices provide opportunities for faster transitions, supportive policies are still needed to provide the enabling conditions such as investments in electricity grids or EV charging networks. Other factors pushing clean energy technology prices down are ample manufacturing capacity and weaker-than-expected demand, which have dented the profit margins of manufacturers in some sectors, notably in the solar PV sector in China. However, other sectors of China’s technology manufacturing have shown greater resilience, specifically in batteries where domestic manufacturers saw profit margins strengthen in the first half of 2024. The report also includes the summary findings of the IEA latest monitoring product – the Real-Time Electricity Tracker – which estimates close to real-time carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the power sector across a range of countries that together account for around half of global electricity generation. In countries covered by the Tracker, aggregate power sector CO2 emissions are more than 1% lower in 2024 than they were at the same point last year. The Real-Time Electricity Tracker shows how an increase in the availability of renewable electricity mitigated a potential surge in emissions due to increased demand during an extremely hot summer in some parts of the world. In India, both electricity demand and emissions are around 5% higher for the year-to-date, compared with 2023. Meanwhile, electricity sectors in the European Union crossed a milestone with renewables accounting for around half of total generation between January and October. Coal- and gas-fired electricity generation combined fell to a record low share of 23% in Europe in the first 10 months of the year, with wind and solar accounting for around 30%.",

        "subtitle": "New IEA report finds strong potential to deliver quality jobs and economic growth with supportive policies that unlock strategic investments in clean energy",
        "body": "With robust policy support in place, renewable energy can become a cornerstone of Namibia’s sustainable development and economic growth, according to a new report from the International Energy Agency (IEA) published today.The report, Renewable Energy Opportunities for Namibia, was carried out in collaboration with Namibia’s Ministry of Mines and Energy. It is the Agency’s first analysis focused exclusively on the country. The launch event, which took place at African Energy Week 2024 in Cape Town, South Africa, featured remarks from IEA Deputy Executive Director Mary Burce Warlick and Namibia’s Minister of Mines and Energy Tom Alweendo. Rita Madeira, the IEA’s Africa Programme Manager, presented key takeaways from the analysis.“Namibia's world-class renewable resources offer a remarkable opportunity for sustainable growth and socioeconomic advancement,” said IEA Deputy Executive Director Mary Burce Warlick. “This new report underlines the importance of strategic investments and collaborative efforts to turn this potential into widespread benefits for Namibians.”\"I am very pleased with the collaboration with the IEA, which has culminated in the report we launched today,” said Namibia’s Minister of Mines and Energy Tom Alweendo. “Our country is home to extraordinary resources – and it has been invaluable to assess these opportunities together with the IEA and consider how they align with our national priorities and vision.”Namibia offers exceptional solar and wind energy potential, with significant year-round sunlight and substantial wind speeds in key areas. This, combined with low seasonal variability and population density, positions Namibia as an ideal location for large-scale renewable energy projects.According to the new report, accelerating the deployment of these renewable energy sources could offer transformative benefits for Namibia’s power sector – reducing the country’s reliance on electricity imports, improving energy security and lowering costs for consumers. Additionally, expanding renewables can support universal electricity access, particularly in remote areas, via off-grid solutions.Renewables can also hold significant advantages for Namibia’s mining industry, which currently accounts for 14% of the country’s GDP and 21% of electricity consumption. Using renewables as an energy source for mining would reduce energy costs for the industry and related emissions, enhancing the sector’s competitiveness in global markets that favour sustainable products. According to the report, Namibia is also well-positioned to produce renewable hydrogen and its derivatives and establish a new low-emission industry in the region. If designed and managed well, large-scale renewable hydrogen projects, backed by foreign offtake agreements, can attract significant investment and support the development of a skilled workforce with expertise in the sector. Achieving Namibia's ambitions will depend on the interplay of three critical enablers: mobilising affordable financing to reduce the cost of clean energy investment; building long-term partnerships with importing countries to develop new markets for low-emission products; and implementing transparent and predictable policy frameworks. The new report explores how Namibia can weave these elements together, paving the way for the country to unlock its vast renewable energy potential and realise its sustainable development ambitions.",

        "subtitle": "New IEA report finds that sector added 2.5 million jobs worldwide last year, led by clean technology manufacturing, though skills shortages remain a key issue",
        "body": "Employment in the global energy sector grew at a strong pace in 2023, buoyed by a wave of investment in manufacturing clean energy technologies – though shortages of skilled workers remain a major concern for employers looking to hire, according to a new IEA report published today.The third edition of the World Energy Employment report  – which assesses global energy employment by region and technology, offering crucial analysis on the industry’s evolving labour needs – finds that the number of energy jobs globally rose by 3.8% last year, reaching 68 million. By comparison, job growth economy-wide was 2.2%.The largest increase was for jobs in the clean energy sector, which rose by 1.5 million in 2023 and contributed as much as 10% of economy-wide job growth in the leading markets for clean energy technologies. The solar PV industry added over half a million new jobs, spurred by record new installations. Employment in electric vehicle manufacturing and batteries grew by 410 000 as sales reached nearly 20% of the global car market. And while some wind manufacturers experienced layoffs, total employment in the industry still climbed as a record number of new projects entered construction. The oil and gas supply sector added more than 600 000 jobs in 2023 after a period of cautious post-pandemic rehiring. However, global coal employment fell for the third year in a row, declining by around 1%, mostly due to continued improvements in upstream productivity. Growth in energy jobs was led by manufacturing – diverging from previous years, when it was generally led by construction and installation. This largely reflects the 70% rise in clean energy manufacturing investment in 2023 to $200 billion as firms responded to increasing demand for clean energy technologies and new policies.However, a lack of skilled workers in many parts of the energy industry – particularly those requiring high degrees of specialisation, such as grids and nuclear power – remains a substantial bottleneck. For the second year in a row, most respondents to the IEA’s survey of over 190 energy employers across 27 countries reported plans to hire but had difficulties finding qualified applicants for nearly all occupation categories. Though labour shortages in construction have fallen from recent highs in many advanced economies, supply remains tight, with 75% of respondents struggling to hire for these roles. This is contributing to rising wages, and it is a reason real wage growth in the energy sector has fared better than for similar roles elsewhere in the economy.“The global energy sector has been a powerful engine of jobs growth around the world in recent years. And as the energy system continues to transform and grow, rising demand for skilled energy workers is a given,” said Laura Cozzi, the IEA’s Director of Sustainability, Technology and Outlooks. “However, this report shows that greater investment in skills and training is critical. Governments, the private sector and educational and training institutions must work together to improve the hiring pipeline, which will play an important role in shaping on our energy future.”The report also finds that just one-quarter of growth in clean energy jobs since 2019 has occurred in emerging and developing economies outside of China, despite these regions representing two-thirds of the global workforce. According to its analysis, many of these countries have had limited success in attracting the clean energy investment that fuels job creation, with the competitive advantage of lower labour costs insufficient to fully overcome structural barriers such as the lack of a strong existing manufacturing base, limited skills availability and inadequate infrastructure. Addressing this gap requires stronger global cooperation and policy action.Based on early data, energy employment is set to grow by 3% in 2024, a slowdown compared with last year due to the impacts of tight labour markets, elevated interest rates and changes in the expected pipeline of new energy projects.",

Am Freitag setzte sich der AufwÃ¤rtstrend mit einem Tages- und Wochenhoch bei 68,28 Euro/t CO2 fort. Aus der Handelswoche ging es dann mit einem Wochenplus von 5,8 Prozent auf 67,69 Euro/t CO2. Das Wochentief wurde bei 62,37 Euro/t CO2 markiert. Eine geringe Windeinspeisung hat zu einem starken Anstieg der Stromproduktion aus konventionellen Kraftwerken gefÃ¼hrt.

Um 12 Uhr notierte der EUA-Dezember-Future 2,4 Prozent fester bei 67,96 Euro/t CO2.Investmentfonds senken Netto-Shortposition weiterDie Investmentfonds im EU-ETS haben ihre Netto-Shortposition in der vergangenen Woche deutlich reduziert. Nachdem sich diese bereits in KW 44 um 4,5 Mio. EUAs auf 10,6 Mio. EUAs verringert hatte, sank die Netto-Shortposition mit Stand 8. November um 8,1 Mio. EUAs auf 2,5 Mio. EUAs und damit auf den niedrigsten Stand seit 15 Monaten. Insbesondere die Long-Positionen wurden erhÃ¶ht, und zwar um 5,4 Mio. EUAs auf 44,5 Mio. EUAs. Die Short-Positionen reduzierten sich um 2,8 Mio. EUAs auf 47,1 Mio. EUAs. Angesichts der geopolitischen Unsicherheiten und einer starken Nachfrage durch die Dunkelflaute in der Vorwoche ist die Stimmung der spekulativen Marktteilnehmer offenbar nicht mehr bearish. Sollte die Position in nÃ¤chster Zeit gar auf Netto-Long gedreht werden, wÃ¤re dies als bullishes Signal zu werten.Weltweite CO2-Emissionen steigen weiter anLaut einer Studie des Global Carbon Project (GCP) wird die EU ihre CO2-Emissionen in diesem Jahr voraussichtlich um fast 4 Prozent senken. Dies ist zum einen auf hÃ¶here Einspeisungen der erneuerbaren Energien zurÃ¼ckzufÃ¼hren. Da der Grund jedoch auch bei der schwachen Wirtschaft liegt, ist die Zahl nicht ganz so positiv zu betrachten. Zudem werden die globalen Emissionen in diesem Jahr voraussichtlich 37,4 Mrd. t erreichen, was einem Anstieg von 0,8 Prozent gegenÃ¼ber dem Vorjahr entspricht. Die Kohle macht weiterhin den grÃ¶Ã?ten Anteil der fossilen EnergietrÃ¤ger aus, allerdings nehmen die Emissionen aus der Kohleverbrennung aktuell nur leicht zu (plus 0,2 Prozent) im Vergleich zu den hÃ¶heren Anstiegen bei Ã?l (plus 0,9 Prozent) und Gas (plus 2,4 Prozent). Besonders auffÃ¤llig ist der starke Anstieg des CO2-AusstoÃ?es in Indien im Jahr 2024 (plus 4,6 Prozent) â?? und zwar bei allen EnergietrÃ¤gern. Laut Judith Hauck, Umweltforscherin am Alfred-Wegener-Institut (AWI), wÃ¤chst der Energiebedarf dort schneller als der Ausbau erneuerbarer Energien. In China hingegen steigen die CO2-Emissionen nur leicht um 0,2 Prozent, wobei die Emissionen aus Ã?l sogar zurÃ¼ckgehen. Dies hÃ¤ngt laut Hauck mit der MobilitÃ¤tswende hin zur ElektromobilitÃ¤t zusammen, die in China bereits fortschreitet.â?",

        "body": "“The Swedish air force has for a long time blocked offshore wind development, but last week’s decision was significant in its size and scale,” Giles Dickson told Montel’s latest weekly podcast released today. \nThe Swedish government shocked industry by cancelling 13 offshore wind power projects in the Baltic Sea, which with a combined capacity of 32 GW could have met almost all of Sweden’s current power demand.\n“Disappointed”“We are especially disappointed because we are not convinced in Wind Europe that the military factors, significant though they may be perceived to be by the Swedish air force, are the main reason why the Swedish government has decided to cancel these projects,” he said.\nDickson pointed out that the current centre-right coalition in Stockholm depended on the support of the far-right Sweden Democrats party, which is hostile to wind power.\n“Maybe the military factor was in some way a convenient excuse for the Swedish government [to reject the project],” said Dickson – who also stressed that all the countries around the Baltic Sea had found more constructive ways to overcome military objections to offshore wind.\nLost millionsLocal developer OX2, which saw four of its projects being cancelled, also said last week’s decision came as a huge surprise.\n“Tens of millions of euros have been put into these four projects that have now been rejected,” said Emilie Zakrisson, head of offshore Sweden at the group.\nThobias Wikstrom, a former lieutenant colonel turned CEO of Parachute Consulting, said he was less surprised about the decision, since Sweden’s military traditionally had a strong voice in the country’s permitting process and the situation in the region was tense following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and Sweden’s recent inclusion in Nato.\n“But the magnitude [of the decision] was perhaps surprising. It is a big map that is now blocked [for offshore wind power],” said the consultant, with projects being banned from the Oresund strait near Denmark to the Aaland islands near Finland.\nSweden currently has only 200 MW of offshore wind capacity, but the technology is seen as key to meeting an expected power demand of 300 TWh by 2045, up from 135 TWh currently due to wider electrification.",

        "body": "Their comments came after Ursula von der Leyen last Friday told reporters that US LNG supply could support “trade deficit” discussions, adding: “We still get a lot of LNG from Russia and why not replace it with American LNG?”\n“It absolutely makes sense to offer this,” said Andreas Schroeder, head of energy analytics at Icis. “The US is a reliable partner and Europe is in desperate need for gas at least for 10 years and it just makes sense… while also playing into reducing the trade deficit.”\nAfter Trump imposed a slew of tariffs in his first presidential term, he promised more in his latest campaign. Although he has focused mainly on China, he has also called the EU a “mini China”.\nHowever, EU and member state policymakers may be limited in how much they can do to increase US LNG supplies.\n“The intention is to get more US LNG, but there is nothing Leyen or Trump can do there,” said Mike Fulwood, senior research fellow in the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, adding that the decision was in the hands of offtakers and buyers.\nGrowing consensus?Sanctioning Russian LNG would pave the way for more US imports by opening a supply gap that European companies could fill, analysts said.\nEurope was on track to import similar volumes of Russian LNG this year as the record set in 2022 of around 20bcm, according to preliminary Kpler ship-tracking data.\nThe continent was currently in dire need of Russian LNG, said Massimo Di Odoardo, vice president of gas and LNG research at Wood Mackenzie, but when global production capacity vastly increased from 2026/27, it could cut its dependence.\n“If Europe imports less Russian LNG, inevitably it will be compensated by more US LNG,” he said. “My perception is that consensus is growing among EU countries for sanctions on Russian LNG.”\nSanctionsAdditionally, the EU would need to sanction Russian LNG to exit Russian gas by 2027, said Schroeder, referring to the EU’s non-binding goal to end Russian gas imports by that year.\nThe European Commission aims to present a roadmap early next year for ending Russian gas imports to the EU before 2027.\nHowever, the EU lacked consensus on sanctions, said analysts. “It seems highly unlikely they would sanction Russian LNG,” said Fulwood.\nSchroeder was also sceptical: “I don’t see sanctions coming so quickly. So far, they haven’t managed to agree on sanctions, not just because of Hungary, but because of the French position because Total has too much to lose,” he said, noting the only agreement to date had been on transshipments.\nBut without sanctions, EU buyers cannot break long-term supply agreements with Russia to replace with US LNG.\nLong-term dealsThe EU could implement policies to entice companies, analysts agreed.\n“The EU could create a more benign policy framework that provides more clarity for European utilities to contract more US LNG. European buyers can certainly commit more to buying US LNG,” said Massimo Di Odoardo, vice president of gas and LNG research at Wood Mackenzie.\n“For the EU to use US LNG as a bargaining chip to limit US tariffs, the EU would need to support more long-term contracts to facilitate more US FIDs [final investment decisions].”\n“With the US you could find agreement for 10-year contracts, with much more flexibility,” said Schroeder. “It’s something to offer to the Americans.”",
